        "summary": "  Fractal image compression, Culik's image compression and zerotree prediction\ncoding of wavelet image decomposition coefficients succeed only because typical\nimages being compressed possess a significant degree of self-similarity.\nBesides the common concept, these methods turn out to be even more tightly\nrelated, to the point of algorithmical reducibility of one technique to\nanother. The goal of the present paper is to demonstrate these relations.\n  The paper offers a plain-term interpretation of Culik's image compression, in\nregular image processing terms, without resorting to finite state machines and\nsimilar lofty language. The interpretation is shown to be algorithmically\nrelated to an IFS fractal image compression method: an IFS can be exactly\ntransformed into Culik's image code. Using this transformation, we will prove\nthat in a self-similar (part of an) image any zero wavelet coefficient is the\nroot of a zerotree, or its branch.\n  The paper discusses the zerotree coding of (wavelet/projection) coefficients\nas a common predictor/corrector, applied vertically through different layers of\na multiresolutional decomposition, rather than within the same view. This\ninterpretation leads to an insight into the evolution of image compression\ntechniques: from a causal single-layer prediction, to non-causal same-view\npredictions (wavelet decomposition among others) and to a causal cross-layer\nprediction (zero-trees, Culik's method).\n",

We point out that GVF presents numerical problems due to\ndiscontinuities image intensity. This point is considered from a practical\nviewpoint from which the GVF parameters must follow a relationship in order to\nimprove numerical convergence. Besides, we present an analytical analysis of\nthe GVF dependency from the parameters values. Also, we observe that the method\ncan be used for multiply connected domains by just imposing the suitable\nboundary condition. In the experimental results we verify these theoretical\npoints and demonstrate the utility of GVF on a segmentation approach that we\nhave developed based on snakes.\n",

This paper posits a new image information content definition.\nFollowing the theory of Solomonoff-Kolmogorov-Chaitin's complexity, we define\nimage information content as a set of descriptions of imafe data structures.\nThree levels of such description can be generally distinguished: 1)the global\nlevel, where the coarse structure of the entire scene is initially outlined; 2)\nthe intermediate level, where structures of separate, non-overlapping image\nregions usually associated with individual scene objects are deliniated; and 3)\nthe low-level description, where local image structures observed in a limited\nand restricted field of view are resolved. A technique for creating such image\ninformation content descriptors is developed. Its algorithm is presented and\nelucidated with some examples, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the\nproposed approach.\n",

        "summary": "  In this paper we present an unconventional image segmentation approach which\nis devised to meet the requirements of image understanding and pattern\nrecognition tasks. Generally image understanding assumes interplay of two\nsub-processes: image information content discovery and image information\ncontent interpretation. Despite of its widespread use, the notion of \"image\ninformation content\" is still ill defined, intuitive, and ambiguous. Most\noften, it is used in the Shannon's sense, which means information content\nassessment averaged over the whole signal ensemble. Humans, however,rarely\nresort to such estimates. They are very effective in decomposing images into\ntheir meaningful constituents and focusing attention to the perceptually\nrelevant image parts. We posit that following the latest findings in human\nattention vision studies and the concepts of Kolmogorov's complexity theory an\nunorthodox segmentation approach can be proposed that provides effective image\ndecomposition to information preserving image fragments well suited for\nsubsequent image interpretation. We provide some illustrative examples,\ndemonstrating effectiveness of this approach.\n",

        "summary": "  A novel biologically motivated face recognition algorithm based on polar\nfrequency is presented. Polar frequency descriptors are extracted from face\nimages by Fourier-Bessel transform (FBT). Next, the Euclidean distance between\nall images is computed and each image is now represented by its dissimilarity\nto the other images. A Pseudo-Fisher Linear Discriminant was built on this\ndissimilarity space. The performance of Discrete Fourier transform (DFT)\ndescriptors, and a combination of both feature types was also evaluated. The\nalgorithms were tested on a 40- and 1196-subjects face database (ORL and FERET,\nrespectively). With 5 images per subject in the training and test datasets,\nerror rate on the ORL database was 3.8, 1.25 and 0.2% for the FBT, DFT, and the\ncombined classifier, respectively, as compared to 2.6% achieved by the best\nprevious algorithm. The most informative polar frequency features were\nconcentrated at low-to-medium angular frequencies coupled to low radial\nfrequencies. On the FERET database, where an affine normalization\npre-processing was applied, the FBT algorithm outperformed only the PCA in a\nrank recognition test. However, it achieved performance comparable to\nstate-of-the-art methods when evaluated by verification tests. These results\nindicate the high informative value of the polar frequency content of face\nimages in relation to recognition and verification tasks, and that the\nCartesian frequency content can complement information about the subjects'\nidentity, but possibly only when the images are not pre-normalized. Possible\nimplications for human face recognition are discussed.\n",

Since we can distinguish moving\nobjects from static elements of a scene by analyzing norm of the optical flow\nvectors, we choose the optical flow norm as initial data. In order to have the\ncontour as close as possible to an edge in the image, we use a classical edge\ndetector function as the weight of the weighted total variation.

Our approach is direct, fast and robust, and\ndeals with adjacent frames of a sequence. It is based on a quadratic\napproximation of the deformation between two images, in the case of a scene\nwith constant depth in the camera coordinate system. This condition is very\nrestrictive but we show that provided translation and depth inverse variations\nare small enough, the error on optical flow involved by the approximation of\ndepths by a constant is small. In this context, we propose a new model of\ncamera motion, that allows to separate the image deformation in a similarity\nand a ``purely'' projective application, due to change of optical axis\ndirection. This model leads to a quadratic approximation of image deformation\nthat we estimate with an M-estimator; we can immediatly deduce camera motion\nparameters.\n",

Automatic solution of these\nproblems requires models that incorporate significant prior knowledge about the\nshape of the region. Many methods for including such knowledge run into\ndifficulties when the topology of the region is unknown a priori, for example\nwhen the entity is composed of an unknown number of similar objects.\nHigher-order active contours (HOACs) represent one method for the modelling of\nnon-trivial prior knowledge about shape without necessarily constraining region\ntopology, via the inclusion of non-local interactions between region boundary\npoints in the energy defining the model. The case of an unknown number of\ncircular objects arises in a number of domains, e.g. medical, biological,\nnanotechnological, and remote sensing imagery. Regions composed of an a priori\nunknown number of circles may be referred to as a `gas of circles'. In this\nreport, we present a HOAC model of a `gas of circles'. In order to guarantee\nstable circles, we conduct a stability analysis via a functional Taylor\nexpansion of the HOAC energy around a circular shape. This analysis fixes one\nof the model parameters in terms of the others and constrains the rest. In\nconjunction with a suitable likelihood energy, we apply the model to the\nextraction of tree crowns from aerial imagery, and show that the new model\noutperforms other techniques.\n",

Bayesian methods have been previously proposed in (Heas and Datcu,\n2005) to code the information contained in satellite image sequences in a graph\nrepresentation using Bayesian methods. Based on such a representation, this\npaper further presents a supervised learning methodology of semantics\nassociated to spatio-temporal patterns occurring in satellite image sequences.\nIt enables the recognition and the probabilistic retrieval of similar events.\nIndeed, graphs are attached to statistical models for spatio-temporal\nprocesses, which at their turn describe physical changes in the observed scene.\nTherefore, we adjust a parametric model evaluating similarity types between\ngraph patterns in order to represent user-specific semantics attached to\nspatio-temporal phenomena. The learning step is performed by the incremental\ndefinition of similarity types via user-provided spatio-temporal pattern\nexamples attached to positive or/and negative semantics. From these examples,\nprobabilities are inferred using a Bayesian network and a Dirichlet model. This\nenables to links user interest to a specific similarity model between graph\npatterns. According to the current state of learning, semantic posterior\nprobabilities are updated for all possible graph patterns so that similar\nspatio-temporal phenomena can be recognized and retrieved from the image\nsequence.

But no assumption is made regarding the language or\ncharacter set used to write the text. In particular, the text can contain\nsimple graphics or symbols. The key feature of our approach is that we first\nconcentrate on finding the background of the text, before testing whether there\nis actually text on the background. Since uniform areas are easy to find in\nnatural images, and since text backgrounds define areas which contain \"holes\"\n(where the text is written) we thus look for uniform areas containing \"holes\"\nand label them as text backgrounds candidates. Each candidate area is then\nfurther tested for the presence of text within its convex hull. We tested our\nmethod on a database of 65 images including English and Urdu text. The method\ncorrectly segmented all the text areas in 63 of these images, and in only 4 of\nthese were areas that do not contain text also segmented.\n",

To each plane or spatial\ncurve we assign a plane signature curve. Curves, equivalent under an affine\ntransformation, have the same signature. The signatures introduced in this\npaper are based on integral invariants, which behave much better on noisy\nimages than classically known differential invariants. The comparison with\nother types of invariants is given in the introduction. Though the integral\ninvariants for planar curves were known before, the affine integral invariants\nfor spatial curves are proposed here for the first time. Using the inductive\nvariation of the moving frame method we compute affine invariants in terms of\nEuclidean invariants. We present two types of signatures, the global signature\nand the local signature. Both signatures are independent of parameterization\n(curve sampling). The global signature depends on the choice of the initial\npoint and does not allow us to compare fragments of curves, and is therefore\nsensitive to occlusions. The local signature, although is slightly more\nsensitive to noise, is independent of the choice of the initial point and is\nnot sensitive to occlusions in an image. It helps establish local equivalence\nof curves. The robustness of these invariants and signatures in their\napplication to the problem of classification of noisy spatial curves extracted\nfrom a 3D object is analyzed.\n",

This extraction has two steps: segmentation and splitting.\nFor the segmentation step, if there is a sufficient contrast between the\ndifferent components, a classical threshold procedure followed by a succession\nof morphological filters can be applied. If not, and if the boundary needs to\nbe localized precisely, a watershed transformation controlled by labels is\napplied. The basement of this transformation is to localize a label included in\nthe component and another label in the component complementary. A \"soft\"\nthreshold following by an opening is applied on the initial image to localize a\nlabel in a component. For any segmentation procedure, the visualisation shows a\nproblem: some groups of two grains, close one to each other, become connected.\nSo if a classical cluster procedure is applied on the segmented binary image,\nthese numerical connected grains are considered as a single grain. To overcome\nthis problem, we applied a procedure introduced by L. Vincent in 1993.

We eventually perform recognition by effective\nmatching in the reduced space, where Linear Discriminant Analysis can be\nfurther activated for improved recognition performance.

Therefore, the classifier\nconsiders purely appearance-based feature vectors, thus requiring\ncomputationally expensive feature extraction or complex probabilistic modelling\nto achieve satisfactory robustness. In contrast, our approach consists in\nclassifying graphs of keypoints, which incorporates structural information\nduring the classification phase and allows the extraction of simpler feature\nvectors that are naturally robust. In the present work, 3-vertices graphs have\nbeen considered, though the methodology is general and larger order graphs may\nbe adopted.

Rather than estimating posterior probabilities, we bound\nthe probability that any given word is incorrect under very general\nassumptions, using an approximate worst case analysis. As a result, the\nparameters of the model are nearly irrelevant, and we are able to identify a\nsubset of words, even in noisy documents, of which we are highly confident. On\nour set of 10 documents, we are able to identify about 6% of the words on\naverage without making a single error. This ability to produce word lists with\nvery high precision allows us to use a family of models which depends upon such\nclean word lists.\n",

We create a\nlook-up table of light field transformers of canonical optical elements. The\ntwo key conclusions are that (i) in free space, the 4D light field completely\nrepresents wavefront propagation via rays with real (positive as well as\nnegative) valued radiance and (ii) at occluders, a light field composed of\nlight field transformers plus insertion of (ray--based) virtual light sources\nrepresents resultant phase and amplitude of wavefronts.

For\noccluders, we show that the light field transform is simply based on a\nconvolution followed by a multiplication operation.

The necessity to process large volumes of such data creates a need\nfor automatic segmentation tools which would allow the estimation to be carried\nout with maximum accuracy and efficiency. In particular, the use of transrectal\nultrasound (TRUS) imaging in prostate cancer screening seems to be becoming a\nstandard clinical practice due to the high benefit-to-cost ratio of this\nimaging modality.

While this works in some applications, the model\nfails when one is interested in discovering {\\it changes in scene dynamics}\nrather than those in a static background; detection of unusual pedestrian and\nmotor traffic patterns is but one example. We propose a new model and\ncomputational framework that address this failure by considering stationary\nscene dynamics as a ``background'' with which observed scene dynamics are\ncompared. Central to our approach is the concept of an {\\it event}, that we\ndefine as short-term scene dynamics captured over a time window at a specific\nspatial location in the camera field of view. We compute events by\ntime-aggregating motion labels, obtained by background subtraction, as well as\nobject descriptors (e.g., object size). Subsequently, we characterize events\nprobabilistically, but use a low-memory, low-complexity surrogates in practical\nimplementation. Using these surrogates amounts to {\\it behavior subtraction}, a\nnew algorithm with some surprising properties.

        "summary": "  The problem of restoration of digital images from their degraded measurements\nplays a central role in a multitude of practically important applications. A\nparticularly challenging instance of this problem occurs in the case when the\ndegradation phenomenon is modeled by an ill-conditioned operator. In such a\ncase, the presence of noise makes it impossible to recover a valuable\napproximation of the image of interest without using some a priori information\nabout its properties. Such a priori information is essential for image\nrestoration, rendering it stable and robust to noise. Particularly, if the\noriginal image is known to be a piecewise smooth function, one of the standard\npriors used in this case is defined by the Rudin-Osher-Fatemi model, which\nresults in total variation (TV) based image restoration. The current arsenal of\nalgorithms for TV-based image restoration is vast. In the present paper, a\ndifferent approach to the solution of the problem is proposed based on the\nmethod of iterative shrinkage (aka iterated thresholding). In the proposed\nmethod, the TV-based image restoration is performed through a recursive\napplication of two simple procedures, viz. linear filtering and soft\nthresholding. Therefore, the method can be identified as belonging to the group\nof first-order algorithms which are efficient in dealing with images of\nrelatively large sizes. Another valuable feature of the proposed method\nconsists in its working directly with the TV functional, rather then with its\nsmoothed versions. Moreover, the method provides a single solution for both\nisotropic and anisotropic definitions of the TV functional, thereby\nestablishing a useful connection between the two formulae.\n",

Nonetheless, pigment\nmelanin provides a rich feature source in VL, unavailable in Near-Infrared\n(NIR) imaging. This is due to biological spectroscopy of eumelanin, a chemical\nnot stimulated in NIR. In this case, a plausible solution to observe such\npatterns may be provided by an adaptive procedure using a variational technique\non the image histogram. To describe the patterns, a shape analysis method is\nused to derive feature-code for each subject. An important question is how much\nthe melanin patterns, extracted from VL, are independent of iris texture in\nNIR. With this question in mind, the present investigation proposes fusion of\nfeatures extracted from NIR and VL to boost the recognition performance.

For example, image\ncategorization often relies on uniform voting among the nearest prototypes in\nthe space of descriptors. In spite of its good properties, the classic k-NN\nrule suffers from high variance when dealing with sparse prototype datasets in\nhigh dimensions. A few techniques have been proposed to improve k-NN\nclassification, which rely on either deforming the nearest neighborhood\nrelationship or modifying the input space. In this paper, we propose a novel\nboosting algorithm, called UNN (Universal Nearest Neighbors), which induces\nleveraged k-NN, thus generalizing the classic k-NN rule. We redefine the voting\nrule as a strong classifier that linearly combines predictions from the k\nclosest prototypes. Weak classifiers are learned by UNN so as to minimize a\nsurrogate risk. A major feature of UNN is the ability to learn which prototypes\nare the most relevant for a given class, thus allowing one for effective data\nreduction. Experimental results on the synthetic two-class dataset of Ripley\nshow that such a filtering strategy is able to reject \"noisy\" prototypes. We\ncarried out image categorization experiments on a database containing eight\nclasses of natural scenes.

We conducted nearly\n20,000 clinical MR image registration experiments and evaluated the quality of\nregistrations both quantitatively and qualitatively. The evaluations show that\nintensity variations between images degrades the accuracy of registration\nperformance.

Such algorithm\nis different from the traditional approaches in this area, by utilizing priors\nthat are learned from similar images. Original images and their degraded\nversions by the known degradation operators are utilized for designing the\nQuantization. The code vectors are designed using the blurred images. For each\nsuch vector, the high frequency information obtained from the original images\nis also available. During restoration, the high frequency information of a\ngiven degraded image is estimated from its low frequency information based on\nthe artificial noise. For the restoration problem, a number of techniques are\ndesigned corresponding to various versions of the blurring function. Given a\nnoisy and blurred image, one of the techniques is chosen based on a similarity\nmeasure, therefore providing the identification of the blur. To make the\nrestoration process computationally efficient, the Quantization Nearest\nNeighborhood approaches are utilized.\n",

        "summary": "  This paper proposes a new technique based on nonlinear Adaptive Median filter\n(AMF) for image restoration. Image denoising is a common procedure in digital\nimage processing aiming at the removal of noise, which may corrupt an image\nduring its acquisition or transmission, while retaining its quality. This\nprocedure is traditionally performed in the spatial or frequency domain by\nfiltering. The aim of image enhancement is to reconstruct the true image from\nthe corrupted image. The process of image acquisition frequently leads to\ndegradation and the quality of the digitized image becomes inferior to the\noriginal image. Filtering is a technique for enhancing the image. Linear filter\nis the filtering in which the value of an output pixel is a linear combination\nof neighborhood values, which can produce blur in the image. Thus a variety of\nsmoothing techniques have been developed that are non linear. Median filter is\nthe one of the most popular non-linear filter. When considering a small\nneighborhood it is highly efficient but for large window and in case of high\nnoise it gives rise to more blurring to image. The Centre Weighted Median (CWM)\nfilter has got a better average performance over the median filter [8]. However\nthe original pixel corrupted and noise reduction is substantial under high\nnoise condition. Hence this technique has also blurring affect on the image. To\nillustrate the superiority of the proposed approach by overcoming the existing\nproblem, the proposed new scheme (AMF) Adaptive Median Filter has been\nsimulated along with the standard ones and various performance measures have\nbeen compared.\n",

This is mainly due to that the effectiveness of clinical diagnosis\nusing CT image lies on the image quality. The denoising technique for CT images\nusing window-based Multi-wavelet transformation and thresholding shows the\neffectiveness in denoising, however, a drawback exists in selecting the closer\nwindows in the process of window-based multi-wavelet transformation and\nthresholding. Generally, the windows of the duplicate noisy image that are\ncloser to each window of original noisy image are obtained by the checking them\nsequentially. This leads to the possibility of missing out very closer windows\nand so enhancement is required in the aforesaid process of the denoising\ntechnique. In this paper, we propose a GA-based window selection methodology to\ninclude the denoising technique. With the aid of the GA-based window selection\nmethodology, the windows of the duplicate noisy image that are very closer to\nevery window of the original noisy image are extracted in an effective manner.\nBy incorporating the proposed GA-based window selection methodology, the\ndenoising the CT image is performed effectively.

Recently, offline object detectors have\nshown a tremendous success. However, one major drawback of offline techniques\nis that a complete set of training data has to be collected beforehand. In\naddition, once learned, an offline detector can not make use of newly arriving\ndata. To alleviate these drawbacks, online learning has been adopted with the\nfollowing objectives: (1) the technique should be computationally and storage\nefficient; (2) the updated classifier must maintain its high classification\naccuracy. In this paper, we propose an effective and efficient framework for\nlearning an adaptive online greedy sparse linear discriminant analysis (GSLDA)\nmodel. Unlike many existing online boosting detectors, which usually apply\nexponential or logistic loss, our online algorithm makes use of LDA's learning\ncriterion that not only aims to maximize the class-separation criterion but\nalso incorporates the asymmetrical property of training data distributions.

Under the\nnew method, scientific theories are compared by instantiating them as\ncompression programs, and examining the codelengths they achieve on a database\nof measurements related to a phenomenon of interest. Because of the\nimpossibility of compressing random data, \"real world\" data can only be\ncompressed by discovering and exploiting the empirical structure it exhibits.\nThe method also provides a new way of thinking about two longstanding issues in\nthe philosophy of science: the problem of induction and the problem of\ndemarcation.\n  The second part of the paper proposes to reformulate computer vision as an\nempirical science of visual reality, by applying the new method to large\ndatabases of natural images. The immediate goal of the proposed reformulation\nis to repair the chronic difficulties in evaluation experienced by the field of\ncomputer vision. The reformulation should bring a wide range of benefits,\nincluding a substantially increased degree of methodological rigor, the ability\nto justify complex theories without overfitting, a scalable evaluation\nparadigm, and the potential to make systematic progress.

Consequently, automation for classifying bleeding frames not only\nwill expedite the process but will reduce the burden on the doctors. Using the\npurity of the red color we can detect the Bleeding areas in WCE images. But, we\ncould find various intensity of red color values in different parts of the\nsmall intestinal,so it is not enough to depend on the red color feature alone.\nWe select RGB(Red,Green,Blue) because it takes raw level values and it is easy\nto use. In this paper we will put range ratio color for each of R,G,and B.\nTherefore, we divide each image into multiple pixels and apply the range ratio\ncolor condition for each pixel. Then we count the number of the pixels that\nachieved our condition. If the number of pixels grater than zero, then the\nframe is classified as a bleeding type. Otherwise, it is a non-bleeding.

The proposed work deals with the authentication of iris\nand signature based on minimum variance criteria. The iris patterns are\npreprocessed based on area of the connected components. The segmented image\nused for authentication consists of the region with large variations in the\ngray level values. The image region is split into quadtree components. The\ncomponents with minimum variance are determined from the training samples. Hu\nmoments are applied on the components. The summation of moment values\ncorresponding to minimum variance components are provided as input vector to\nk-means and fuzzy kmeans classifiers. The best performance was obtained for MMU\ndatabase consisting of 45 subjects. The number of subjects with zero False\nRejection Rate [FRR] was 44 and number of subjects with zero False Acceptance\nRate [FAR] was 45. This paper addresses the computational load reduction in\noff-line signature verification based on minimal features using k-means, fuzzy\nk-means, k-nn, fuzzy k-nn and novel average-max approaches. FRR of 8.13% and\nFAR of 10% was achieved using k-nn classifier. The signature is a biometric,\nwhere variations in a genuine case, is a natural expectation. In the genuine\nsignature, certain parts of signature vary from one instance to another. The\nsystem aims to provide simple, fast and robust system using less number of\nfeatures when compared to state of art works.\n",

To overcome this problem, the\npresent paper introduces a novel approach segmentation through the use of\n\"weak\" shape priors. Specifically, in the proposed method, an segmenting active\ncontour is constrained to converge to a configuration at which its geometric\nparameters attain their empirical probability densities closely matching the\ncorresponding model densities that are learned based on training samples. It is\nshown through numerical experiments that the proposed shape modeling can be\nregarded as \"weak\" in the sense that it minimally influences the segmentation,\nwhich is allowed to be dominated by data-related forces. On the other hand, the\npriors provide sufficient constraints to regularize the convergence of\nsegmentation, while requiring substantially smaller training sets to yield less\nbiased results as compared to the case of PCA-based regularization methods. The\nmain advantages of the proposed technique over some existing alternatives is\ndemonstrated in a series of experiments.\n",

Techniques for\nminimizing curvature have historically been derived from descent methods which\ncould be trapped in a local minimum and therefore required a good\ninitialization. Recently, combinatorial optimization techniques have been\napplied to the optimization of curvature which provide a solution that achieves\nnearly a global optimum. However, when applied to image segmentation these\nmethods required a meaningful data term. Unfortunately, for many images,\nparticularly medical images, it is difficult to find a meaningful data term.\nTherefore, we propose to remove the data term completely and instead weight the\ncurvature locally, while still achieving a global optimum.\n",

In the proposed system, the method-1\nnamely \"Decompose then Quotient Fuse Level-1\" and the method-2 namely\n\"Decompose-Reconstruct then Quotient Fuse Level-2\" both work on wavelet\ntransformations of the visual and thermal face images. The wavelet transform is\nwell-suited to manage different image resolution and allows the image\ndecomposition in different kinds of coefficients, while preserving the image\ninformation without any loss. This approach is based on a definition of an\nillumination invariant signature image which enables an analytic generation of\nthe image space with varying illumination. The quotient fused images are passed\nthrough Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimension reduction and then\nthose images are classified using a multi-layer perceptron (MLP). The\nperformances of both the methods have been evaluated using OTCBVS and IRIS\ndatabases. All the different classes have been tested separately, among them\nthe maximum recognition result is 100%.\n",

However, a major\ndisadvantage of the technique is that it is extremely slow during training for\nlarger classes and hence not suitable for real-time complex problems such as\npattern recognition. This is an attempt to develop a parallel framework for the\ntraining algorithm of a perceptron. In this paper, two general architectures\nfor a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) have been demonstrated. The first\narchitecture is All-Class-in-One-Network (ACON) where all the classes are\nplaced in a single network and the second one is One-Class-in-One-Network\n(OCON) where an individual single network is responsible for each and every\nclass. Capabilities of these two architectures were compared and verified in\nsolving human face recognition, which is a complex pattern recognition task\nwhere several factors affect the recognition performance like pose variations,\nfacial expression changes, occlusions, and most importantly illumination\nchanges. Both the structures were implemented and tested for face recognition\npurpose and experimental results show that the OCON structure performs better\nthan the generally used ACON ones in term of training convergence speed of the\nnetwork. Unlike the conventional sequential approach of training the neural\nnetworks, the OCON technique may be implemented by training all the classes of\nthe face images simultaneously.\n",

Motility assays of this small\nroundworm are designed to study the relationships between genes and behavior.\nCommonly, motility analysis is used to classify nematode movements and\ncharacterize them quantitatively. Over the past years, C. elegans' motility has\nbeen studied across a wide range of environments, including crawling on\nsubstrates, swimming in fluids, and locomoting through microfluidic substrates.\nHowever, each environment often requires customized image processing tools\nrelying on heuristic parameter tuning. In the present study, we propose a novel\nMulti-Environment Model Estimation (MEME) framework for automated image\nsegmentation that is versatile across various environments. The MEME platform\nis constructed around the concept of Mixture of Gaussian (MOG) models, where\nstatistical models for both the background environment and the nematode\nappearance are explicitly learned and used to accurately segment a target\nnematode. Our method is designed to simplify the burden often imposed on users;\nhere, only a single image which includes a nematode in its environment must be\nprovided for model learning.

        "summary": "  Human ovarian reserve is defined by the population of nongrowing follicles\n(NGFs) in the ovary. Direct estimation of ovarian reserve involves the\nidentification of NGFs in prepared ovarian tissue. Previous studies involving\nhuman tissue have used hematoxylin and eosin (HE) stain, with NGF populations\nestimated by human examination either of tissue under a microscope, or of\nimages taken of this tissue. In this study we replaced HE with proliferating\ncell nuclear antigen (PCNA), and automated the identification and enumeration\nof NGFs that appear in the resulting microscopic images. We compared the\nautomated estimates to those obtained by human experts, with the \"gold\nstandard\" taken to be the average of the conservative and liberal estimates by\nthree human experts. The automated estimates were within 10% of the \"gold\nstandard\", for images at both 100x and 200x magnifications. Automated analysis\ntook longer than human analysis for several hundred images, not allowing for\nbreaks from analysis needed by humans. Our results both replicate and improve\non those of previous studies involving rodent ovaries, and demonstrate the\nviability of large-scale studies of human ovarian reserve using a combination\nof immunohistochemistry and computational image analysis techniques.\n",

Hence to achieve better results, the feature\nfusion model with multiple weighted facial attribute set is selected.

The deterministic 2D Cellular\nautomata model captures the human facial expressions, both spontaneous and\nposed. The determinism stems from the fact that the facial muscle actions are\nstandardized by the encodings of Facial Action Coding System (FACS) and Action\nUnits (AUs). Based on these encodings, we generate the set of evolutionary\nupdate rules of the DCA for each facial expression. We consider a\nPerson-Independent Facial Expression Space (PIFES) to analyze the facial\nexpressions based on Partitioned 2D-Cellular Automata which capture the\ndynamics of facial expressions and classify the shots based on it. Target video\nshot is retrieved by comparing the similar expression is obtained for the query\nframe's face with respect to the key faces expressions in the database video.\nConsecutive key face expressions in the database that are highly similar to the\nquery frame's face, then the key faces are used to generate the set of\nretrieved video shots from the database. A concrete example of its application\nwhich realizes an affective interaction between the computer and the user is\nproposed.

The resulting summaries are useful in many applications including image\nindexing, image authentication and pattern recognition. These hashes need to be\ninvariant under transformations of the image that result in similar visual\ncontent, but should drastically differ for conceptually distinct contents. This\npaper proposes an image hashing method that is invariant under rotation,\nscaling and translation of the image. The gist of our approach relies on the\ngeometric characterization of salient point distribution in the image. This is\nachieved by the definition of a \"saliency graph\" connecting these points\njointly with an image intensity function on the graph nodes. An invariant hash\nis then obtained by considering the spectrum of this function in the\neigenvector basis of the Laplacian graph, that is, its graph Fourier transform.\nInterestingly, this spectrum is invariant under any relabeling of the graph\nnodes. The graph reveals geometric information of the image, making the hash\nrobust to image transformation, yet distinct for different visual content.

        "summary": "  Image segmentation has been a very active research topic in image analysis\narea. Currently, most of the image segmentation algorithms are designed based\non the idea that images are partitioned into a set of regions preserving\nhomogeneous intra-regions and inhomogeneous inter-regions. However, human\nvisual intuition does not always follow this pattern. A new image segmentation\nmethod named Visual-Hint Boundary to Segment (VHBS) is introduced, which is\nmore consistent with human perceptions. VHBS abides by two visual hint rules\nbased on human perceptions: (i) the global scale boundaries tend to be the real\nboundaries of the objects; (ii) two adjacent regions with quite different\ncolors or textures tend to result in the real boundaries between them. It has\nbeen demonstrated by experiments that, compared with traditional image\nsegmentation method, VHBS has better performance and also preserves higher\ncomputational efficiency.\n",

        "summary": "  The so-called factorization methods recover 3-D rigid structure from motion\nby factorizing an observation matrix that collects 2-D projections of features.\nThese methods became popular due to their robustness - they use a large number\nof views, which constrains adequately the solution - and computational\nsimplicity - the large number of unknowns is computed through an SVD, avoiding\nnon-linear optimization. However, they require that all the entries of the\nobservation matrix are known. This is unlikely to happen in practice, due to\nself-occlusion and limited field of view. Also, when processing long videos,\nregions that become occluded often appear again later. Current factorization\nmethods process these as new regions, leading to less accurate estimates of 3-D\nstructure. In this paper, we propose a global factorization method that infers\ncomplete 3-D models directly from the 2-D projections in the entire set of\navailable video frames. Our method decides whether a region that has become\nvisible is a region that was seen before, or a previously unseen region, in a\nglobal way, i.e., by seeking the simplest rigid object that describes well the\nentire set of observations. This global approach increases significantly the\naccuracy of the estimates of the 3-D shape of the scene and the 3-D motion of\nthe camera. Experiments with artificial and real videos illustrate the good\nperformance of our method.\n",

        "summary": "  In image analysis, many tasks require representing two-dimensional (2D)\nshape, often specified by a set of 2D points, for comparison purposes. The\nchallenge of the representation is that it must not only capture the\ncharacteristics of the shape but also be invariant to relevant transformations.\nInvariance to geometric transformations, such as translation, rotation, and\nscale, has received attention in the past, usually under the assumption that\nthe points are previously labeled, i.e., that the shape is characterized by an\nordered set of landmarks. However, in many practical scenarios, the points\ndescribing the shape are obtained from automatic processes, e.g., edge or\ncorner detection, thus without labels or natural ordering. Obviously, the\ncombinatorial problem of computing the correspondences between the points of\ntwo shapes in the presence of the aforementioned geometrical distortions\nbecomes a quagmire when the number of points is large. We circumvent this\nproblem by representing shapes in a way that is invariant to the permutation of\nthe landmarks, i.e., we represent bags of unlabeled 2D points. Within our\nframework, a shape is mapped to an analytic function on the complex plane,\nleading to what we call its analytic signature (ANSIG). To store an ANSIG, it\nsuffices to sample it along a closed contour in the complex plane. We show that\nthe ANSIG is a maximal invariant with respect to the permutation group, i.e.,\nthat different shapes have different ANSIGs and shapes that differ by a\npermutation (or re-labeling) of the landmarks have the same ANSIG. We further\nshow how easy it is to factor out geometric transformations when comparing\nshapes using the ANSIG representation. Finally, we illustrate these\ncapabilities with shape-based image classification experiments.\n",

Translation and\nscale are easily taken care of by removing the mean and normalizing the energy.\nHowever, defining and computing the orientation of a 2D shape is not so simple.\nIn fact, although for elongated shapes the principal axis can be used to define\none of two possible orientations, there is no such tool for general shapes. As\nwe show in the paper, previous approaches fail to compute the orientation of\neven noiseless observations of simple shapes. We address this problem. In the\npaper, we show how to uniquely define the orientation of an arbitrary 2D shape,\nin terms of what we call its Principal Moments. We show that a small subset of\nthese moments suffice to represent the underlying 2D shape and propose a new\nmethod to efficiently compute the shape orientation: Principal Moment Analysis.\nFinally, we discuss how this method can further be applied to normalize\ngrey-level images.

The approach is based on C-HiLasso, a\nconvex collaborative hierarchical sparse model, and proceeds as follows. First,\nwe build a structured dictionary for mixed signals by concatenating a set of\nsub-dictionaries, each one of them learned to sparsely model one of a set of\npossible classes. Then, the coding of the mixed signal is performed by\nefficiently solving a convex optimization problem that combines standard\nsparsity with group and collaborative sparsity. The present sources are\nidentified by looking at the sub-dictionaries automatically selected in the\ncoding. The collaborative filtering in C-HiLasso takes advantage of the\ntemporal/spatial redundancy in the mixed signals, letting collections of\nsamples collaborate in identifying the classes, while allowing individual\nsamples to have different internal sparse representations. This collaboration\nis critical to further stabilize the sparse representation of signals, in\nparticular the class/sub-dictionary selection. The internal sparsity inside the\nsub-dictionaries, as naturally incorporated by the hierarchical aspects of\nC-HiLasso, is critical to make the model consistent with the essence of the\nsub-dictionaries that have been trained for sparse representation of each\nindividual class. We present applications from speaker and instrument\nidentification and texture separation. In the case of audio signals, we use\nsparse modeling to describe the short-term power spectrum envelopes of harmonic\nsounds.

The proposed algorithm relaxes the\nusual assumption of the stationary noise model in sparse coding. This enables\nlearning from data corrupted with spatially varying noise or uncertainty,\ntypically obtained by laser range scanners or structured light depth cameras.\nSparse representations are learned from the Middlebury database disparity maps\nand then exploited in a two-layer graphical model for inferring depth from\nstereo, by including a sparsity prior on the learned features. Since they\ncapture higher-order dependencies in the depth structure, these priors can\ncomplement smoothness priors commonly used in depth inference based on Markov\nRandom Field (MRF) models. Inference on the proposed graph is achieved using an\nalternating iterative optimization technique, where the first layer is solved\nusing an existing MRF-based stereo matching algorithm, then held fixed as the\nsecond layer is solved using the proposed non-stationary sparse coding\nalgorithm. This leads to a general method for improving solutions of state of\nthe art MRF-based depth estimation algorithms. Our experimental results first\nshow that depth inference using learned representations leads to state of the\nart denoising of depth maps obtained from laser range scanners and a time of\nflight camera.

We present a head\ntracker which is a combination of a optical flow and a template based tracker.\nThe estimation of the optical flow head tracker is used as starting point for\nthe template tracker which fine-tunes the head estimation. This approach\ntogether with re-updating the optical flow points prevents the head tracker\nfrom drifting. This combination together with our switching scheme, makes our\ntracker very robust against fast movement and motion-blur. We also propose a\nway to reduce the influence of partial occlusion of the head. In both the\noptical flow and the template based tracker we identify and exclude occluded\npoints.\n",

The strategy of combining Cb/Cr and Cr features\nimproved the correct detection by 3.01% compared to the best single feature MLP\ngiven by Cb-Cr.

The latter observation has\nnot prevented the design of image representations, which trade off between\nefficiency and complexity, while achieving accurate rendering of smooth regions\nas well as reproducing faithful contours and textures. The most recent ones,\nproposed in the past decade, share an hybrid heritage highlighting the\nmultiscale and oriented nature of edges and patterns in images. This paper\npresents a panorama of the aforementioned literature on decompositions in\nmultiscale, multi-orientation bases or dictionaries. They typically exhibit\nredundancy to improve sparsity in the transformed domain and sometimes its\ninvariance with respect to simple geometric deformations (translation,\nrotation). Oriented multiscale dictionaries extend traditional wavelet\nprocessing and may offer rotation invariance. Highly redundant dictionaries\nrequire specific algorithms to simplify the search for an efficient (sparse)\nrepresentation. We also discuss the extension of multiscale geometric\ndecompositions to non-Euclidean domains such as the sphere or arbitrary meshed\nsurfaces. The etymology of panorama suggests an overview, based on a choice of\npartially overlapping \"pictures\".

We define DS as a large layout of stochastically repetitive spatial\nconfigurations of dynamic objects (swarm elements) whose motions exhibit local\nspatiotemporal interdependency and stationarity, i.e., the motions are similar\nin any small spatiotemporal neighborhood. Examples of DS abound in nature,\ne.g., herds of animals and flocks of birds. To capture the local spatiotemporal\nproperties of the DS, we present a probabilistic model that learns both the\nspatial layout of swarm elements and their joint dynamics that are modeled as\nlinear transformations. To this end, a spatiotemporal neighborhood is\nassociated with each swarm element, in which local stationarity is enforced\nboth spatially and temporally. We assume that the prior on the swarm dynamics\nis distributed according to an MRF in both space and time. Embedding this model\nin a MAP framework, we iterate between learning the spatial layout of the swarm\nand its dynamics. We learn the swarm transformations using ICM, which iterates\nbetween estimating these transformations and updating their distribution in the\nspatiotemporal neighborhoods. We demonstrate the validity of our method by\nconducting experiments on real video sequences. Real sequences of birds, geese,\nrobot swarms, and pedestrians evaluate the applicability of our model to real\nworld data.\n",

        "summary": "  Due to the factors like processing power limitations and channel capabilities\nimages are often down sampled and transmitted at low bit rates resulting in a\nlow resolution compressed image. High resolution images can be reconstructed\nfrom several blurred, noisy and down sampled low resolution images using a\ncomputational process know as super resolution reconstruction. Super-resolution\nis the process of combining multiple aliased low-quality images to produce a\nhigh resolution, high-quality image. The problem of recovering a high\nresolution image progressively from a sequence of low resolution compressed\nimages is considered. In this paper we propose a novel DCT based progressive\nimage display algorithm by stressing on the encoding and decoding process. At\nthe encoder we consider a set of low resolution images which are corrupted by\nadditive white Gaussian noise and motion blur. The low resolution images are\ncompressed using 8 by 8 blocks DCT and noise is filtered using our proposed\nnovel zonal filter. Multiframe fusion is performed in order to obtain a single\nnoise free image. At the decoder the image is reconstructed progressively by\ntransmitting the coarser image first followed by the detail image. And finally\na super resolution image is reconstructed by applying our proposed novel\nadaptive interpolation technique. We have performed both objective and\nsubjective analysis of the reconstructed image, and the resultant image has\nbetter super resolution factor, and a higher ISNR and PSNR.

However, none of them satisfy this goal perfectly: they each have\nexception cases in which smoothing may occur across hard edges. The principal\ncontribution of this paper is the identification of a property we call edge\nawareness that should be satisfied by any discontinuity preserving smoothing\nalgorithm. This constraint can be incorporated into existing algorithms to\nimprove quality, and usually has negligible changes in runtime performance\nand/or complexity. We present modifications necessary to augment diffusion and\nmean shift, as well as a new formulation of the bilateral filter that unifies\nthe spatial and range spaces to achieve edge awareness.\n",

        "summary": "  The fundamental matrix and trifocal tensor are convenient algebraic\nrepresentations of the epipolar geometry of two and three view configurations,\nrespectively. The estimation of these entities is central to most\nreconstruction algorithms, and a solid understanding of their properties and\nconstraints is therefore very important. The fundamental matrix has 1 internal\nconstraint which is well understood, whereas the trifocal tensor has 8\nindependent algebraic constraints. The internal tensor constraints can be\nrepresented in many ways, although there is only one minimal and sufficient set\nof 8 constraints known. In this paper, we derive a second set of minimal and\nsufficient constraints that is simpler. We also show how this can be used in a\nnew parameterization of the trifocal tensor. We hope that this increased\nunderstanding of the internal constraints may lead to improved algorithms for\nestimating the trifocal tensor, although the primary contribution is an\nimproved theoretical understanding.\n",

Despite considerable\ndifferences among different theories in terms of how part boundaries are found,\nthere is substantial agreement on that the process depends on many local and\nglobal geometric factors. This poses an important challenge from the\ncomputational point of view. In the first part of the chapter, I present a\nnovel decomposition method by taking both local and global interactions within\nthe shape domain into account. At the top of the partitioning hierarchy, the\nshape gets split into two parts capturing, respectively, the gross structure\nand the peripheral structure. The gross structure may be conceived as the least\ndeformable part of the shape which remains stable under visual transformations.\nThe peripheral structure includes limbs, protrusions, and boundary texture.\nSuch a separation is in accord with the behavior of the artists who start with\na gross shape and enrich it with details. The method is particularly\ninteresting from the computational point of view as it does not resort to any\ngeometric notions (e.g. curvature, convexity) explicitly.

Learning a valid Mahalanobis distance\nmetric requires enforcing the constraint that the matrix parameter to the\nmetric remains positive definite. Semidefinite programming is often used to\nenforce this constraint, but does not scale well and easy to implement.\nBoostMetric is instead based on the observation that any positive semidefinite\nmatrix can be decomposed into a linear combination of trace-one rank-one\nmatrices. BoostMetric thus uses rank-one positive semidefinite matrices as weak\nlearners within an efficient and scalable boosting-based learning process. The\nresulting methods are easy to implement, efficient, and can accommodate various\ntypes of constraints.

We\nthen prune the tree in a supervised setting, hence the name supervised\nclustering, in order to extract a parcellation (division of the volume) such\nthat parcel-based signal averages best predict the target information.\nDimensionality reduction is thus achieved by feature agglomeration, and the\nconstructed features now provide a multi-scale representation of the signal.\nComparisons with reference methods on both simulated and real data show that\nour approach yields higher prediction accuracy than standard voxel-based\napproaches.

Topological invariants, like the Euler\nnumber, characterize the structure of objects of any dimension. Cohomology can\nprovide more refined algebraic invariants to a topological space than does\nhomology. It assigns `quantities' to the chains used in homology to\ncharacterize holes of any dimension. Graph pyramids can be used to describe\nsubdivisions of the same object at multiple levels of detail. This paper\npresents cohomology in the context of structural pattern recognition and\nintroduces an algorithm to efficiently compute representative cocycles (the\nbasic elements of cohomology) in 2D using a graph pyramid.

In recent works camera characteristics\nconsistency across the image has been used to establish the authenticity and\nintegrity of digital images.

Its best matching object and its\nstate estimated by the Kalman filter are combined to update position and size\nof the tracked object.

Firstly, the high-intensity feature vectors are automatically\nextracted using the local characteristics of each individual face from the\nGabor transformed images. Then ICA is applied on these locally extracted\nhigh-intensity feature vectors of the facial images to obtain the independent\nhigh intensity feature (IHIF) vectors. These IHIF forms the basis of the work.\nFinally, the image classification is done using these IHIF vectors, which are\nconsidered as representatives of the images. The importance behind implementing\nICA along with the high-intensity features of Gabor wavelet transformation is\ntwofold. On the one hand, selecting peaks of the Gabor transformed face images\nexhibit strong characteristics of spatial locality, scale, and orientation\nselectivity. Thus these images produce salient local features that are most\nsuitable for face recognition. On the other hand, as the ICA employs locally\nsalient features from the high informative facial parts, it reduces redundancy\nand represents independent features explicitly. These independent features are\nmost useful for subsequent facial discrimination and associative recall.

Automatic detection of TIB patterns is a challenging\ntask because of their weak boundary, noisy appearance, and small lesion size.\nIn this paper, we present two novel methods for automatically detecting TIB\npatterns: (1) a fast localization of candidate patterns using information from\nlocal scale of the images, and (2) a M\\\"{o}bius invariant feature extraction\nmethod based on learned local shape and texture properties. A comparative\nevaluation of the proposed methods is presented with a dataset of 39 laboratory\nconfirmed viral bronchiolitis human parainfluenza (HPIV) CTs and 21 normal lung\nCTs. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CAD system can achieve\nhigh detection rate with an overall accuracy of 90.96%.\n",

        "summary": "  We present a fully automated method for top-down segmentation of the\npulmonary arterial tree in low-dose thoracic CT images. The main basal\npulmonary arteries are identified near the lung hilum by searching for\ncandidate vessels adjacent to known airways, identified by our previously\nreported airway segmentation method. Model cylinders are iteratively fit to the\nvessels to track them into the lungs. Vessel bifurcations are detected by\nmeasuring the rate of change of vessel radii, and child vessels are segmented\nby initiating new trackers at bifurcation points. Validation is accomplished\nusing our novel sparse surface (SS) evaluation metric. The SS metric was\ndesigned to quantify the magnitude of the segmentation error per vessel while\nsignificantly decreasing the manual marking burden for the human user. A total\nof 210 arteries and 205 veins were manually marked across seven test cases.\n134/210 arteries were correctly segmented, with a specificity for arteries of\n90%, and average segmentation error of 0.15 mm. This fully-automated\nsegmentation is a promising method for improving lung nodule detection in\nlow-dose CT screening scans, by separating vessels from surrounding\niso-intensity objects.\n",

We assume that the images are correlated through the displacement\nof visual objects due to motion or viewpoint change and the correlation is\neffectively represented by optical flow or motion field models. The correlation\nis estimated in the compressed domain by jointly processing the linear\nmeasurements. We first show that the correlated images can be efficiently\nrelated using a linear operator. Using this linear relationship we then\ndescribe the dependencies between images in the compressed domain. We further\ncast a regularized optimization problem where the correlation is estimated in\norder to satisfy both data consistency and motion smoothness objectives with a\nGraph Cut algorithm. We analyze in detail the correlation estimation\nperformance and quantify the penalty due to image compression. Extensive\nexperiments in stereo and video imaging applications show that our novel\nsolution stays competitive with methods that implement complex image\nreconstruction steps prior to correlation estimation. We finally use the\nestimated correlation in a novel joint image reconstruction scheme that is\nbased on an optimization problem with sparsity priors on the reconstructed\nimages. Additional experiments show that our correlation estimation algorithm\nleads to an effective reconstruction of pairs of images in distributed image\ncoding schemes that outperform independent reconstruction algorithms by 2 to 4\ndB.\n",

The computation is performed in a constant number of\noperations per pixel using running sums along the image rows and columns. We\ninvestigate the error function used for kernel approximation and its relation\nto the properties of the input signal. Based on natural image statistics we\npropose a quadratic form kernel error function so that the output image l2\nerror is minimized. We apply the proposed approach to approximate the Gaussian\nkernel by linear combination of constant functions. This results in very\nefficient Gaussian filtering method.

        "summary": "  We introduce a novel tracking technique which uses dynamic confidence-based\nfusion of two different information sources for robust and efficient tracking\nof visual objects. Mean-shift tracking is a popular and well known method used\nin object tracking problems. Originally, the algorithm uses a similarity\nmeasure which is optimized by shifting a search area to the center of a\ngenerated weight image to track objects. Recent improvements on the original\nmean-shift algorithm involves using a classifier that differentiates the object\nfrom its surroundings. We adopt this classifier-based approach and propose an\napplication of a classifier fusion technique within this classifier-based\ncontext in this work. We use two different classifiers, where one comes from a\nbackground modeling method, to generate the weight image and we calculate\ncontributions of the classifiers dynamically using their confidences to\ngenerate a final weight image to be used in tracking. The contributions of the\nclassifiers are calculated by using correlations between histograms of their\nweight images and histogram of a defined ideal weight image in the previous\nframe. We show with experiments that our dynamic combination scheme selects\ngood contributions for classifiers for different cases and improves tracking\naccuracy significantly.\n",

Object detection in a video is usually performed by object\ndetectors or background subtraction techniques. Often, an object detector\nrequires manually labeled examples to train a binary classifier, while\nbackground subtraction needs a training sequence that contains no objects to\nbuild a background model. To automate the analysis, object detection without a\nseparate training phase becomes a critical task. People have tried to tackle\nthis task by using motion information. But existing motion-based methods are\nusually limited when coping with complex scenarios such as nonrigid motion and\ndynamic background. In this paper, we show that above challenges can be\naddressed in a unified framework named DEtecting Contiguous Outliers in the\nLOw-rank Representation (DECOLOR). This formulation integrates object detection\nand background learning into a single process of optimization, which can be\nsolved by an alternating algorithm efficiently.

Carefully\ndesigned capture methods exploit the sparsity of the underlying signal in a\ntransformed domain to reduce the number of measurements and use an appropriate\nreconstruction method. Traditional progressive methods may capture successively\nmore detail using a sequence of simple projection basis, such as DCT or\nwavelets and employ straightforward backprojection for reconstruction.\nRandomized projection methods do not use any specific sequence and use L0\nminimization for reconstruction.

Using the\nwell-known Cayley representation of orthogonal matrices, we derive from the\nepipolar constraints a system of three polynomial equations in three variables.\nThe eliminant of that system is a multiple of a 36th degree univariate\npolynomial.

        "summary": "  Global voting schemes based on the Hough transform (HT) have been widely used\nto robustly detect lines in images. However, since the votes do not take line\nconnectivity into account, these methods do not deal well with cluttered\nimages. In opposition, the so-called local methods enforce connectivity but\nlack robustness to deal with challenging situations that occur in many\nrealistic scenarios, e.g., when line segments cross or when long segments are\ncorrupted. In this paper, we address the critical limitations of the HT as a\nline segment extractor by incorporating connectivity in the voting process.\nThis is done by only accounting for the contributions of edge points lying in\nincreasingly larger neighborhoods and whose position and directional content\nagree with potential line segments. As a result, our method, which we call\nSTRAIGHT (Segment exTRAction by connectivity-enforcInG HT), extracts the\nlongest connected segments in each location of the image, thus also integrating\ninto the HT voting process the usually separate step of individual segment\nextraction. The usage of the Hough space mapping and a corresponding\nhierarchical implementation make our approach computationally feasible. We\npresent experiments that illustrate, with synthetic and real images, how\nSTRAIGHT succeeds in extracting complete segments in several situations where\ncurrent methods fail.\n",

The goal is to develop algorithmic techniques that enable a\nrobust, real-time motion registration solution suitable for low-cost, portable\n3-D camera devices. Assuming 3-D image features are tracked via a standard\ntracker, the algorithm first utilizes Robust PCA to initialize a low-rank shape\nrepresentation of the rigid body. Robust PCA finds the global optimal solution\nof the initialization, while its complexity is comparable to singular value\ndecomposition. In the online update stage, we propose a more efficient\nalgorithm for sparse subspace projection to sequentially project new feature\nobservations onto the shape subspace. The lightweight update stage guarantees\nthe real-time performance of the solution while maintaining good registration\neven when the image sequence is contaminated by noise, gross data corruption,\noutlying features, and missing data. The state-of-the-art accuracy of the\nsolution is validated through extensive simulation and a real-world experiment,\nwhile the system enjoys one to two orders of magnitude speed-up compared to\nwell-established RANSAC solutions.

By generalizing this idea and by combining\nit with a non-standard variant of the Central Limit Theorem, a constant-time or\nO(1) algorithm was proposed in [Chaudhury2010] that allowed one to perform\nspace-variant filtering using Gaussian-like kernels. The algorithm was based on\nthe observation that both isotropic and anisotropic Gaussians could be\napproximated using certain bivariate splines called box splines. The attractive\nfeature of the algorithm was that it allowed one to continuously control the\nshape and size (covariance) of the filter, and that it had a fixed\ncomputational cost per pixel, irrespective of the size of the filter.

SR is a technique to estimate a\nspatially high-resolution image from given multiple low-resolution images. An\nMRF model with the line process supplies a preferable prior for natural images\nwith edges. We improve the existing image transformation model, the compound\nMRF model, and its hyperparameter prior model. We also derive the optimal\nestimator -- not the joint maximum a posteriori (MAP) or marginalized maximum\nlikelihood (ML), but the posterior mean (PM) -- from the objective function of\nthe L2-norm (mean square error) -based peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR). Point\nestimates such as MAP and ML are generally not stable in ill-posed\nhigh-dimensional problems because of overfitting, while PM is a stable\nestimator because all the parameters in the model are evaluated as\ndistributions. The estimator is numerically determined by using variational\nBayes. Variational Bayes is a widely used method that approximately determines\na complicated posterior distribution, but it is generally hard to use because\nit needs the conjugate prior. We solve this problem with simple Taylor\napproximations. Experimental results have shown that the proposed method is\nmore accurate or comparable to existing methods.\n",

        "summary": "  Recently, the face recognizers based on linear representations have been\nshown to deliver state-of-the-art performance. In real-world applications,\nhowever, face images usually suffer from expressions, disguises and random\nocclusions. The problematic facial parts undermine the validity of the\nlinear-subspace assumption and thus the recognition performance deteriorates\nsignificantly. In this work, we address the problem in a\nlearning-inference-mixed fashion. By observing that the linear-subspace\nassumption is more reliable on certain face patches rather than on the holistic\nface, some Bayesian Patch Representations (BPRs) are randomly generated and\ninterpreted according to the Bayes' theory. We then train an ensemble model\nover the patch-representations by minimizing the empirical risk w.r.t the\n\"leave-one-out margins\". The obtained model is termed Optimal Representation\nEnsemble (ORE), since it guarantees the optimality from the perspective of\nEmpirical Risk Minimization. To handle the unknown patterns in test faces, a\nrobust version of BPR is proposed by taking the non-face category into\nconsideration. Equipped with the Robust-BPRs, the inference ability of ORE is\nincreased dramatically and several record-breaking accuracies (99.9% on Yale-B\nand 99.5% on AR) and desirable efficiencies (below 20 ms per face in Matlab)\nare achieved. It also overwhelms other modular heuristics on the faces with\nrandom occlusions, extreme expressions and disguises. Furthermore, to\naccommodate immense BPRs sets, a boosting-like algorithm is also derived. The\nboosted model, a.k.a Boosted-ORE, obtains similar performance to its prototype.\nBesides the empirical superiorities, two desirable features of the proposed\nmethods, namely, the training-determined model-selection and the\ndata-weight-free boosting procedure, are also theoretically verified.\n",

For the purpose of feature extraction, instead of considering the entire\nface image, an entropy-based local band selection criterion is developed, which\nselects high-informative horizontal segments from the face image. In order to\ncapture the local spatial variations within these highinformative horizontal\nbands precisely, the horizontal band is segmented into several small spatial\nmodules. Dominant wavelet coefficients corresponding to each local region\nresiding inside those horizontal bands are selected as features. In the\nselection of the dominant coefficients, a threshold criterion is proposed,\nwhich not only drastically reduces the feature dimension but also provides high\nwithin-class compactness and high between-class separability. A principal\ncomponent analysis is performed to further reduce the dimensionality of the\nfeature space.

        "summary": "  Fast and robust hand segmentation and tracking is an essential basis for\ngesture recognition and thus an important component for contact-less\nhuman-computer interaction (HCI). Hand gesture recognition based on 2D video\ndata has been intensively investigated. However, in practical scenarios purely\nintensity based approaches suffer from uncontrollable environmental conditions\nlike cluttered background colors. In this paper we present a real-time hand\nsegmentation and tracking algorithm using Time-of-Flight (ToF) range cameras\nand intensity data. The intensity and range information is fused into one pixel\nvalue, representing its combined intensity-depth homogeneity. The scene is\nhierarchically clustered using a GPU based parallel merging algorithm, allowing\na robust identification of both hands even for inhomogeneous backgrounds. After\nthe detection, both hands are tracked on the CPU. Our tracking algorithm can\ncope with the situation that one hand is temporarily covered by the other hand.\n",

        "title": "A New Similarity Measure for Non-Local Means Filtering of MRI Images",
        "summary": "  The acquisition of MRI images offers a trade-off in terms of acquisition\ntime, spatial/temporal resolution and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Thus, for\ninstance, increasing the time efficiency of MRI often comes at the expense of\nreduced SNR. This, in turn, necessitates the use of post-processing tools for\nnoise rejection, which makes image de-noising an indispensable component of\ncomputer assistance diagnosis. In the field of MRI, a multitude of image\nde-noising methods have been proposed hitherto. In this paper, the application\nof a particular class of de-noising algorithms - known as non-local mean (NLM)\nfilters - is investigated. Such filters have been recently applied for MRI data\nenhancement and they have been shown to provide more accurate results as\ncompared to many alternative de-noising algorithms. Unfortunately, virtually\nall existing methods for NLM filtering have been derived under the assumption\nof additive white Gaussian (AWG) noise contamination. Since this assumption is\nknown to fail at low values of SNR, an alternative formulation of NLM filtering\nis required, which would take into consideration the correct Rician statistics\nof MRI noise. Accordingly, the contribution of the present paper is two-fold.\nFirst, it points out some principal disadvantages of the earlier methods of NLM\nfiltering of MRI images and suggests means to rectify them. Second, the paper\nintroduces a new similarity measure for NLM filtering of MRI Images, which is\nderived under bona fide statistical assumptions and results in more accurate\nreconstruction of MR scans as compared to alternative NLM approaches. Finally,\nthe utility and viability of the proposed method is demonstrated through a\nseries of numerical experiments using both in silico and in vivo MRI data.\n",

The resulting sparse\nrepresentations have been shown to possess robustness against a variety of\ndistortions like random pixel corruption, occlusion and disguise. This approach\nhowever makes the restrictive (in many scenarios) assumption that test faces\nmust be perfectly aligned (or registered) to the training data prior to\nclassification. In this paper, we propose a simple yet robust local block-based\nsparsity model, using adaptively-constructed dictionaries from local features\nin the training data, to overcome this misalignment problem. Our approach is\ninspired by human perception: we analyze a series of local discriminative\nfeatures and combine them to arrive at the final classification decision. We\npropose a probabilistic graphical model framework to explicitly mine the\nconditional dependencies between these distinct sparse local features. In\nparticular, we learn discriminative graphs on sparse representations obtained\nfrom distinct local slices of a face. Conditional correlations between these\nsparse features are first discovered (in the training phase), and subsequently\nexploited to bring about significant improvements in recognition rates.\nExperimental results obtained on benchmark face databases demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed algorithms in the presence of multiple\nregistration errors (such as translation, rotation, and scaling) as well as\nunder variations of pose and illumination.\n",

To date\nIAMs have been studied as embedded submanifolds of Euclidean spaces.\nUnfortunately, their promise has not been realized in practice, because real\nworld imagery typically contains sharp edges that render an IAM\nnon-differentiable and hence non-isometric to the low-dimensional parameter\nspace under the Euclidean metric. As a result, the standard tools from\ndifferential geometry, in particular using linear tangent spaces to transport\nalong the IAM, have limited utility. In this paper, we explore a nonlinear\ntransport operator for IAMs based on the optical flow between images and\ndevelop new analytical tools reminiscent of those from differential geometry\nusing the idea of optical flow manifolds (OFMs).

        "summary": "  We propose in this paper a tracking algorithm which is able to adapt itself\nto different scene contexts. A feature pool is used to compute the matching\nscore between two detected objects. This feature pool includes 2D, 3D\ndisplacement distances, 2D sizes, color histogram, histogram of oriented\ngradient (HOG), color covariance and dominant color. An offline learning\nprocess is proposed to search for useful features and to estimate their weights\nfor each context. In the online tracking process, a temporal window is defined\nto establish the links between the detected objects. This enables to find the\nobject trajectories even if the objects are misdetected in some frames. A\ntrajectory filter is proposed to remove noisy trajectories. Experimentation on\ndifferent contexts is shown. The proposed tracker has been tested in videos\nbelonging to three public datasets and to the Caretaker European project. The\nexperimental results prove the effect of the proposed feature weight learning,\nand the robustness of the proposed tracker compared to some methods in the\nstate of the art. The contributions of our approach over the state of the art\ntrackers are: (i) a robust tracking algorithm based on a feature pool, (ii) a\nsupervised learning scheme to learn feature weights for each context, (iii) a\nnew method to quantify the reliability of HOG descriptor, (iv) a combination of\ncolor covariance and dominant color features with spatial pyramid distance to\nmanage the case of object occlusion.\n",

        "summary": "  Crucial information barely visible to the human eye is often embedded in a\nseries of low-resolution images taken of the same scene. Super-resolution\nenables the extraction of this information by reconstructing a single image, at\na high resolution than is present in any of the individual images. This is\nparticularly useful in forensic imaging, where the extraction of minute details\nin an image can help to solve a crime. Super-resolution image restoration has\nbeen one of the most important research areas in recent years which goals to\nobtain a high resolution (HR) image from several low resolutions (LR) blurred,\nnoisy, under sampled and displaced images. Relation of the HR image and LR\nimages can be modeled by a linear system using a transformation matrix and\nadditive noise. However, a unique solution may not be available because of the\nsingularity of transformation matrix. To overcome this problem, POCS method has\nbeen used. However, their performance is not good because the effect of noise\nenergy has been ignored. In this paper, we propose an adaptive regularization\napproach based on the fact that the regularization parameter should be a linear\nfunction of noise variance. The performance of the proposed approach has been\ntested on several images and the obtained results demonstrate the superiority\nof our approach compared with existing methods.\n",

        "summary": "  This paper presents a novel reaction-diffusion (RD) method for implicit\nactive contours, which is completely free of the costly re-initialization\nprocedure in level set evolution (LSE). A diffusion term is introduced into\nLSE, resulting in a RD-LSE equation, to which a piecewise constant solution can\nbe derived. In order to have a stable numerical solution of the RD based LSE,\nwe propose a two-step splitting method (TSSM) to iteratively solve the RD-LSE\nequation: first iterating the LSE equation, and then solving the diffusion\nequation. The second step regularizes the level set function obtained in the\nfirst step to ensure stability, and thus the complex and costly\nre-initialization procedure is completely eliminated from LSE. By successfully\napplying diffusion to LSE, the RD-LSE model is stable by means of the simple\nfinite difference method, which is very easy to implement. The proposed RD\nmethod can be generalized to solve the LSE for both variational level set\nmethod and PDE-based level set method. The RD-LSE method shows very good\nperformance on boundary anti-leakage, and it can be readily extended to high\ndimensional level set method.

The first step\nin segmentation is to remove intrusive objects such as stain debris and other\nnoises. The next step is detection of touching and overlapping chromosomes, and\nthe final step is separation of such chromosomes. Common methods for separation\nbetween touching chromosomes are interactive and require human intervention for\ncorrect separation between touching and overlapping chromosomes. In this paper,\na geometric-based method is used for automatic detection of touching and\noverlapping chromosomes and separating them. The proposed scheme performs\nsegmentation in two phases. In the first phase, chromosome clusters are\ndetected using three geometric criteria, and in the second phase, chromosome\nclusters are separated using a cut-line. Most of earlier methods did not work\nproperly in case of chromosome clusters that contained more than two\nchromosomes. Our method, on the other hand, is quite efficient in separation of\nsuch chromosome clusters. At each step, one separation will be performed and\nthis algorithm is repeated until all individual chromosomes are separated.\nAnother important point about the proposed method is that it uses the geometric\nfeatures of chromosomes which are independent of the type of images and it can\neasily be applied to any type of images such as binary images and does not\nrequire multispectral images as well.

So it is rarely adopted in the automatic style up to\ntoday. In this paper, we present an automatic image segmentation algorithm,\nNegCut, based on the approximation to MRF-MAP. First we prove MRF-MAP is\nNP-hard when the probabilistic models are unknown, and then present an\napproximation function in the form of minimum cuts on graphs with negative\nweights. Finally, the binary segmentation is taken from the largest eigenvector\nof the target matrix, with a tuned version of the Lanczos eigensolver.

Despite significant progress in the theory and\nmethods of CS, little headway has been made in compressive video acquisition\nand recovery. Video CS is complicated by the ephemeral nature of dynamic\nevents, which makes direct extensions of standard CS imaging architectures and\nsignal models difficult. In this paper, we develop a new framework for video CS\nfor dynamic textured scenes that models the evolution of the scene as a linear\ndynamical system (LDS). This reduces the video recovery problem to first\nestimating the model parameters of the LDS from compressive measurements, and\nthen reconstructing the image frames. We exploit the low-dimensional dynamic\nparameters (the state sequence) and high-dimensional static parameters (the\nobservation matrix) of the LDS to devise a novel compressive measurement\nstrategy that measures only the dynamic part of the scene at each instant and\naccumulates measurements over time to estimate the static parameters. This\nenables us to lower the compressive measurement rate considerably. We validate\nour approach with a range of experiments involving both video recovery, sensing\nhyper-spectral data, and classification of dynamic scenes from compressive\ndata.

Thresholding plays a major\nin binarization of images. Thresholding can be categorized into global\nthresholding and local thresholding. In images with uniform contrast\ndistribution of background and foreground like document images, global\nthresholding is more appropriate. In degraded document images, where\nconsiderable background noise or variation in contrast and illumination exists,\nthere exists many pixels that cannot be easily classified as foreground or\nbackground. In such cases, binarization with local thresholding is more\nappropriate. This paper describes a locally adaptive thresholding technique\nthat removes background by using local mean and mean deviation. Normally the\nlocal mean computational time depends on the window size. Our technique uses\nintegral sum image as a prior processing to calculate local mean. It does not\ninvolve calculations of standard deviations as in other local adaptive\ntechniques. This along with the fact that calculations of mean is independent\nof window size speed up the process as compared to other local thresholding\ntechniques.\n",

Ideally, automatic outline generation will\nimprove the overall user experience and improve the ability of the software to\ncorrectly identify cetaceans.

        "summary": "  Recently the sparse representation based classification (SRC) has been\nproposed for robust face recognition (FR). In SRC, the testing image is coded\nas a sparse linear combination of the training samples, and the representation\nfidelity is measured by the l2-norm or l1-norm of the coding residual. Such a\nsparse coding model assumes that the coding residual follows Gaussian or\nLaplacian distribution, which may not be effective enough to describe the\ncoding residual in practical FR systems. Meanwhile, the sparsity constraint on\nthe coding coefficients makes SRC's computational cost very high. In this\npaper, we propose a new face coding model, namely regularized robust coding\n(RRC), which could robustly regress a given signal with regularized regression\ncoefficients. By assuming that the coding residual and the coding coefficient\nare respectively independent and identically distributed, the RRC seeks for a\nmaximum a posterior solution of the coding problem. An iteratively reweighted\nregularized robust coding (IR3C) algorithm is proposed to solve the RRC model\nefficiently. Extensive experiments on representative face databases demonstrate\nthat the RRC is much more effective and efficient than state-of-the-art sparse\nrepresentation based methods in dealing with face occlusion, corruption,\nlighting and expression changes, etc.\n",

To achieve better performances of\nclassification, experts develop several methods to learn a discriminative\ndictionary in a supervised manner.

We solve this problem by referring to a rectangle shape of the\nobject when sampling the graph nodes, i.e., the nodes are distributed\nnonuniformly and non-equidistantly on the image. This strategy can be useful,\nwhen areas of the object are indistinguishable from the background. For\nevaluation, we focus on vertebrae images from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)\ndatasets to support the time consuming manual slice-by-slice segmentation\nperformed by physicians. The ground truth of the vertebrae boundaries were\nmanually extracted by two clinical experts (neurological surgeons) with several\nyears of experience in spine surgery and afterwards compared with the automatic\nsegmentation results of the proposed scheme yielding an average Dice Similarity\nCoefficient (DSC) of 90.97\\pm62.2%.\n",

        "summary": "  This paper presents a novel Coprime Blurred Pair (CBP) model for visual\ndata-hiding for security in camera surveillance. While most previous approaches\nhave focused on completely encrypting the video stream, we introduce a spatial\nencryption scheme by blurring the image/video contents to create a CBP. Our\ngoal is to obscure detail in public video streams by blurring while allowing\nbehavior to be recognized and to quickly deblur the stream so that details are\navailable if behavior is recognized as suspicious. We create a CBP by blurring\nthe same latent image with two unknown kernels. The two kernels are coprime\nwhen mapped to bivariate polynomials in the z domain. To deblur the CBP we\nfirst use the coprime constraint to approximate the kernels and sample the\nbivariate CBP polynomials in one dimension on the unit circle. At each sample\npoint, we factor the 1D polynomial pair and compose the results into a 2D\nkernel matrix. Finally, we compute the inverse Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of\nthe kernel matrices to recover the coprime kernels and then the latent video\nstream. It is therefore only possible to deblur the video stream if a user has\naccess to both streams. To improve the practicability of our algorithm, we\nimplement our algorithm using a graphics processing unit (GPU) to decrypt the\nblurred video streams in real-time, and extensive experimental results\ndemonstrate that our new scheme can effectively protect sensitive identity\ninformation in surveillance videos and faithfully reconstruct the unblurred\nvideo stream when two blurred sequences are available.\n",

The watershed transform associates to a\ntopographic surface a partition into catchment basins, defined as attraction\nzones of a drop of water falling on the relief and following a line of steepest\ndescent. Unfortunately, catchment basins may overlap and do not form a\npartition. Moreover, current watershed algorithms, being shortsighted, do not\ncorrectly estimate the steepness of the downwards trajectories and overestimate\nthe overlapping zones of catchment basins. An arbitrary division of these zones\nbetween adjacent catchment basin results in a poor localization of the\ncontours. We propose an algorithm without myopia, which considers the total\nlength of a trajectory for estimating its steepness. We first consider\ntopographic surfaces defined on node weighted graphs. The graphs are pruned in\norder to eliminate all downwards trajectories which are not the steepest. An\niterative algorithm with simple neighborhood operations performs the pruning\nand constructs the catchment basins. The algorithm is then adapted to gray tone\nimages.

        "summary": "  By coding a query sample as a sparse linear combination of all training\nsamples and then classifying it by evaluating which class leads to the minimal\ncoding residual, sparse representation based classification (SRC) leads to\ninteresting results for robust face recognition. It is widely believed that the\nl1- norm sparsity constraint on coding coefficients plays a key role in the\nsuccess of SRC, while its use of all training samples to collaboratively\nrepresent the query sample is rather ignored. In this paper we discuss how SRC\nworks, and show that the collaborative representation mechanism used in SRC is\nmuch more crucial to its success of face classification. The SRC is a special\ncase of collaborative representation based classification (CRC), which has\nvarious instantiations by applying different norms to the coding residual and\ncoding coefficient. More specifically, the l1 or l2 norm characterization of\ncoding residual is related to the robustness of CRC to outlier facial pixels,\nwhile the l1 or l2 norm characterization of coding coefficient is related to\nthe degree of discrimination of facial features. Extensive experiments were\nconducted to verify the face recognition accuracy and efficiency of CRC with\ndifferent instantiations.\n",

In real images, the full\ngradients of the edge indicator function along the object boundaries are often\nsmall. Hence, the curve evolution of edge-based active contours can terminate\nearly before converging to the object boundaries with a careless contour\ninitialization. We propose a novel Geodesic Snakes (GeoSnakes) active contour\nthat requires the full gradients of the edge indicator to vanish at the optimal\nsolution. Besides, the conventional curve evolution approach for minimizing\nactive contour energy cannot fully solve the Euler-Lagrange (EL) equation of\nour GeoSnakes active contour, causing a Pseudo Stationary Phenomenon (PSP).

We study\nsimilarity in image registration in the context of Locally Orderless Images\n(LOI), which is the natural way to study density estimates and reveals the 3\nfundamental scales: the measurement scale, the intensity scale, and the\nintegration scale.\n  This paper has three main contributions: Firstly, we rephrase a large set of\npopular similarity measures into a common framework, which we refer to as\nLocally Orderless Registration, and which makes full use of the features of\nlocal histograms. Secondly, we extend the theoretical understanding of the\nlocal histograms. Thirdly, we use our framework to compare two state-of-the-art\nintensity density estimators for image registration: The Parzen Window (PW) and\nthe Generalized Partial Volume (GPV), and we demonstrate their differences on a\npopular similarity measure, Normalized Mutual Information (NMI).\n  We conclude, that complicated similarity measures such as NMI may be\nevaluated almost as fast as simple measures such as Sum of Squared Distances\n(SSD) regardless of the choice of PW and GPV. Also, GPV is an asymmetric\nmeasure, and PW is our preferred choice.\n",

VA has been applied to different problems in medical imaging\nsuch as imaging bones, microcalcifications in the breast, mass lesions, and\ncalcified arteries. The obtained images may have a resolution of 0.7--0.8 mm.\nCurrent VA systems based on confocal or linear array transducers generate\nC-scan images at the beam focal plane. Images on the axial plane are also\npossible, however the system resolution along depth worsens when compared to\nthe lateral one. Typical axial resolution is about 1.0 cm. Furthermore, the\nelevation resolution of linear array systems is larger than that in lateral\ndirection. This asymmetry degrades C-scan images obtained using linear arrays.\nThe purpose of this article is to study VA image restoration based on a 3D\npoint spread function (PSF) using classical deconvolution algorithms: Wiener,\nconstrained least-squares (CLSs), and geometric mean filters. To assess the\nfilters' performance, we use an image quality index that accounts for\ncorrelation loss, luminance and contrast distortion. Results for simulated VA\nimages show that the quality index achieved with the Wiener filter is 0.9 (1\nindicates perfect restoration). This filter yielded the best result in\ncomparison with the other ones.

It then segments the meshes using a graphical\nmodel that captures the spatial contiguity of parts. The segmentation is done\nusing the EM algorithm, iterating between finding a decomposition of the object\ninto rigid parts, and finding the location of the parts in the object\ninstances. Although the graphical model is densely connected, the object\ndecomposition step can be performed optimally and efficiently, allowing us to\nidentify a large number of object parts while avoiding local maxima. We\ndemonstrate the algorithm on real world datasets, recovering a 15-part\narticulated model of a human puppet from just 7 different puppet\nconfigurations, as well as a 4 part model of a fiexing arm where significant\nnon-rigid deformation was present.\n",

        "summary": "  One of the major problems in modeling natural signals is that signals with\nvery similar structure may locally have completely different measurements,\ne.g., images taken under different illumination conditions, or the speech\nsignal captured in different environments. While there have been many\nsuccessful attempts to address these problems in application-specific settings,\nwe believe that underlying a large set of problems in signal representation is\na representational deficiency of intensity-derived local measurements that are\nthe basis of most efficient models. We argue that interesting structure in\nsignals is better captured when the signal is de- fined as a matrix whose\nentries are discrete indices to a separate palette of possible measurements. In\norder to model the variability in signal structure, we define a signal class\nnot by a single index map, but by a probability distribution over the index\nmaps, which can be estimated from the data, and which we call probabilistic\nindex maps. The existing algorithm can be adapted to work with this\nrepresentation. Furthermore, the probabilistic index map representation leads\nto algorithms with computational costs proportional to either the size of the\npalette or the log of the size of the palette, making the cost of significantly\nincreased invariance to non-structural changes quite bearable. We illustrate\nthe benefits of the probabilistic index map representation in several\napplications in computer vision and speech processing.\n",

The energy of piecewise linear\npatch reconstruction is considered as an objective measure of the quality of\nthe segmentation of non-smooth structures. The segmentation is achieved by\nminimizing the single energy without any separate process of feature\nextraction. We also prove that the error of segmentation is bounded by the\nproposed energy functional, meaning that minimizing the proposed energy leads\nto reducing the error of segmentation. As a by-product, our method produces a\ndictionary of optimized orthonormal descriptors for each segmented region. The\nunique feature of our method is that it achieves the simultaneous segmentation\nand description for non-smooth image structures under the same optimization\nframework. The experiments validate our theoretical claims and show the clear\nsuperior performance of our methods over other related methods for segmentation\nof various image textures.

        "summary": "  Biometric time and attendance system is one of the most successful\napplications of biometric technology. One of the main advantage of a biometric\ntime and attendance system is it avoids \"buddy-punching\". Buddy punching was a\nmajor loophole which will be exploiting in the traditional time attendance\nsystems. Fingerprint recognition is an established field today, but still\nidentifying individual from a set of enrolled fingerprints is a time taking\nprocess. Most fingerprint-based biometric systems store the minutiae template\nof a user in the database. It has been traditionally assumed that the minutiae\ntemplate of a user does not reveal any information about the original\nfingerprint. This belief has now been shown to be false; several algorithms\nhave been proposed that can reconstruct fingerprint images from minutiae\ntemplates. In this paper, a novel fingerprint reconstruction algorithm is\nproposed to reconstruct the phase image, which is then converted into the\ngrayscale image. The proposed reconstruction algorithm reconstructs the phase\nimage from minutiae. The proposed reconstruction algorithm is used to automate\nthe whole process of taking attendance, manually which is a laborious and\ntroublesome work and waste a lot of time, with its managing and maintaining the\nrecords for a period of time is also a burdensome task. The proposed\nreconstruction algorithm has been evaluated with respect to the success rates\nof type-I attack (match the reconstructed fingerprint against the original\nfingerprint) and type-II attack (match the reconstructed fingerprint against\ndifferent impressions of the original fingerprint) using a commercial\nfingerprint recognition system. Given the reconstructed image from our\nalgorithm, we show that both types of attacks can be effectively launched\nagainst a fingerprint recognition system.\n",

        "summary": "  A framework for unsupervised group activity analysis from a single video is\nhere presented. Our working hypothesis is that human actions lie on a union of\nlow-dimensional subspaces, and thus can be efficiently modeled as sparse linear\ncombinations of atoms from a learned dictionary representing the action's\nprimitives. Contrary to prior art, and with the primary goal of spatio-temporal\naction grouping, in this work only one single video segment is available for\nboth unsupervised learning and analysis without any prior training information.\nAfter extracting simple features at a single spatio-temporal scale, we learn a\ndictionary for each individual in the video during each short time lapse. These\ndictionaries allow us to compare the individuals' actions by producing an\naffinity matrix which contains sufficient discriminative information about the\nactions in the scene leading to grouping with simple and efficient tools. With\ndiverse publicly available real videos, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the\nproposed framework and its robustness to cluttered backgrounds, changes of\nhuman appearance, and action variability.\n",

Among\nthese diseases occurrence of Glaucoma is most frequent and has serious ocular\nconsequences that can even lead to blindness, if it is not detected early. The\nclinical criteria for the diagnosis of glaucoma include intraocular pressure\nmeasurement, optic nerve head evaluation, retinal nerve fiber layer and visual\nfield defects. This form of blood vessel segmentation helps in early detection\nfor ophthalmic diseases, and potentially reduces the risk of blindness. The\nlow-contrast images at the retina owing to narrow blood vessels of the retina\nare difficult to extract. These low contrast images are, however useful in\nrevealing certain systemic diseases. Motivated by the goals of improving\ndetection of such vessels, this present work proposes an algorithm for\nsegmentation of blood vessels and compares the results between expert\nophthalmologist hand-drawn ground-truths and segmented image(i.e. the output of\nthe present work).Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV),\npositive likelihood ratio (PLR) and accuracy are used to evaluate overall\nperformance.It is found that this work segments blood vessels successfully with\nsensitivity, specificity, PPV, PLR and accuracy of 99.62%, 54.66%, 95.08%,\n219.72 and 95.03%, respectively.\n",

A wide range of heart\ncondition is determined by thorough examination of the features of the ECG\nreport. Automatic extraction of time plane features is important for\nidentification of vital cardiac diseases. This paper presents a\nmulti-resolution wavelet transform based system for detection 'P', 'Q', 'R',\n'S', 'T' peaks complex from original ECG signal. 'R-R' time lapse is an\nimportant minutia of the ECG signal that corresponds to the heartbeat of the\nconcerned person. Abrupt increase in height of the 'R' wave or changes in the\nmeasurement of the 'R-R' denote various anomalies of human heart.

In this proposed\nmethod the 'PQRST' peaks are marked and stored over the entire signal and the\ntime interval between two consecutive 'R' peaks and other peaks interval are\nmeasured to detect anomalies in behavior of heart, if any. The peaks are\nachieved by the composition of Daubeheissub bands wavelet of original ECG\nsignal.

Our analysis leads to an effective convex\nregularizer on the blur kernel which depends only on the given blurry image.

By\ncombining this powerful regularizer with conventional image deblurring\ntechniques, we show how we could significantly improve the deblurring results\nthrough simulations and experiments on real images.

A large body of works for image super resolution\nformulate the problem with Bayesian modeling techniques and then obtain its\nMaximum-A-Posteriori (MAP) solution, which actually boils down to a regularized\nregression task over separable regularization term. Although straightforward,\nthis approach cannot exploit the full potential offered by the probabilistic\nmodeling, as only the posterior mode is sought. Also, the separable property of\nthe regularization term can not capture any correlations between the sparse\ncoefficients, which sacrifices much on its modeling accuracy. We propose a\nBayesian image SR algorithm via sparse modeling of natural images. The sparsity\nproperty of the latent high resolution image is exploited by introducing latent\nvariables into the high-order Markov Random Field (MRF) which capture the\ncontent adaptive variance by pixel-wise adaptation. The high-resolution image\nis estimated via Empirical Bayesian estimation scheme, which is substantially\nfaster than our previous approach based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling\n[1].

Our approach is based on Locally Linear Embedding (LLE), with the\nassumption that with yaw pose being the only variable, the facial images should\nlie in a smooth and low dimensional manifold. We horizontally flip the facial\nimages and present two K-nearest neighbor protocols for the original images and\nthe flipped images, respectively. In the proposed extended LLE, for any facial\nimage (original or flipped one), we search (1) the Ko nearest neighbors among\nthe original facial images and (2) the Kf nearest neighbors among the flipped\nfacial images to construct the same neighborhood graph. The extended LLE\neliminates the differences (because of background, face position and scale in\nthe whole image and some asymmetry of left-right face) between the original\nfacial image and the flipped facial image at the same yaw pose so that the\nflipped facial images can be used effectively.

        "summary": "  The Active Shape Model (ASM) is one of the most popular local texture models\nfor face alignment. It applies in many fields such as locating facial features\nin the image, face synthesis, etc. However, the experimental results show that\nthe accuracy of the classical ASM for some applications is not high. This paper\nsuggests some improvements on the classical ASM to increase the performance of\nthe model in the application: face alignment. Four of our major improvements\ninclude: i) building a model combining Sobel filter and the 2-D profile in\nsearching face in image; ii) applying Canny algorithm for the enhancement edge\non image; iii) Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used to classify landmarks on\nface, in order to determine exactly location of these landmarks support for\nASM; iv)automatically adjust 2-D profile in the multi-level model based on the\nsize of the input image. The experimental results on Caltech face database and\nTechnical University of Denmark database (imm_face) show that our proposed\nimprovement leads to far better performance.\n",

        "summary": "  This paper proves that in iris recognition, the concepts of sheep, goats,\nlambs and wolves - as proposed by Doddington and Yager in the so-called\nBiometric Menagerie, are at most fuzzy and at least not quite well defined.\nThey depend not only on the users or on their biometric templates, but also on\nthe parameters that calibrate the iris recognition system. This paper shows\nthat, in the case of iris recognition, the extensions of these concepts have\nvery unsharp and unstable (non-stationary) boundaries. The membership of a user\nto these categories is more often expressed as a degree (as a fuzzy value)\nrather than as a crisp value. Moreover, they are defined by fuzzy Sugeno rules\ninstead of classical (crisp) definitions. For these reasons, we said that the\nBiometric Menagerie proposed by Doddington and Yager could be at most a fuzzy\nconcept of biometry, but even this status is conditioned by improving its\ndefinition. All of these facts are confirmed experimentally in a series of 12\nexhaustive iris recognition tests undertaken for University of Bath Iris Image\nDatabase while using three different iris code dimensions (256x16, 128x8 and\n64x4), two different iris texture encoders (Log-Gabor and Haar-Hilbert) and two\ndifferent types of safety models.\n",

In\norder to prove that the f-granulation of iris code space with respect to the\nfuzzy concepts that define the biometric menagerie is unstable in noisy\nconditions (is sensitive to noise), three types of noise (localvar, motion\nblur, salt and pepper) have been alternatively added to the iris segments\nextracted from University of Bath Iris Image Database.

        "summary": "  Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a powerful and noninvasive method for\nretinal imaging. In this paper, we introduce a fast segmentation method based\non a new variant of spectral graph theory named diffusion maps. The research is\nperformed on spectral domain (SD) OCT images depicting macular and optic nerve\nhead appearance. The presented approach does not require edge-based image\ninformation and relies on regional image texture. Consequently, the proposed\nmethod demonstrates robustness in situations of low image contrast or poor\nlayer-to-layer image gradients. Diffusion mapping is applied to 2D and 3D OCT\ndatasets composed of two steps, one for partitioning the data into important\nand less important sections, and another one for localization of internal\nlayers.In the first step, the pixels/voxels are grouped in rectangular/cubic\nsets to form a graph node.The weights of a graph are calculated based on\ngeometric distances between pixels/voxels and differences of their mean\nintensity.The first diffusion map clusters the data into three parts, the\nsecond of which is the area of interest. The other two sections are eliminated\nfrom the remaining calculations. In the second step, the remaining area is\nsubjected to another diffusion map assessment and the internal layers are\nlocalized based on their textural similarities.The proposed method was tested\non 23 datasets from two patient groups (glaucoma and normals). The mean\nunsigned border positioning errors(mean - SD) was 8.52 - 3.13 and 7.56 - 2.95\nmicrometer for the 2D and 3D methods, respectively.\n",

The\nreference image of the region is called Ground Truth map (GT). the problematic\nis how to find the good bands to classify the pixels of regions; because the\nbands can be not only redundant, but a source of confusion, and decreasing so\nthe accuracy of classification. Some methods use Mutual Information (MI) and\nthreshold, to select relevant bands. Recently there's an algorithm selection\nbased on mutual information, using bandwidth rejection and a threshold to\ncontrol and eliminate redundancy. The band top ranking the MI is selected, and\nif its neighbors have sensibly the same MI with the GT, they will be considered\nredundant and so discarded. This is the most inconvenient of this method,\nbecause this avoids the advantage of hyperspectral images: some precious\ninformation can be discarded. In this paper we'll make difference between\nuseful and useless redundancy. A band contains useful redundancy if it\ncontributes to decreasing error probability. According to this scheme, we\nintroduce new algorithm using also mutual information, but it retains only the\nbands minimizing the error probability of classification. To control\nredundancy, we introduce a complementary threshold. So the good band candidate\nmust contribute to decrease the last error probability augmented by the\nthreshold. This process is a wrapper strategy; it gets high performance of\nclassification accuracy but it is expensive than filter strategy.\n",

        "summary": "  The model of low-dimensional manifold and sparse representation are two\nwell-known concise models that suggest each data can be described by a few\ncharacteristics. Manifold learning is usually investigated for dimension\nreduction by preserving some expected local geometric structures from the\noriginal space to a low-dimensional one. The structures are generally\ndetermined by using pairwise distance, e.g., Euclidean distance. Alternatively,\nsparse representation denotes a data point as a linear combination of the\npoints from the same subspace. In practical applications, however, the nearby\npoints in terms of pairwise distance may not belong to the same subspace, and\nvice versa. Consequently, it is interesting and important to explore how to get\na better representation by integrating these two models together. To this end,\nthis paper proposes a novel coding algorithm, called Locality-Constrained\nCollaborative Representation (LCCR), which improves the robustness and\ndiscrimination of data representation by introducing a kind of local\nconsistency. The locality term derives from a biologic observation that the\nsimilar inputs have similar code. The objective function of LCCR has an\nanalytical solution, and it does not involve local minima. The empirical\nstudies based on four public facial databases, ORL, AR, Extended Yale B, and\nMultiple PIE, show that LCCR is promising in recognizing human faces from\nfrontal views with varying expression and illumination, as well as various\ncorruptions and occlusions.\n",

We augment these AOSI activities\nwith an additional test that analyzes asymmetrical patterns in unsupported\ngait. The first set of algorithms involves assessing head motion by tracking\nfacial features, while the gait analysis relies on joint foreground\nsegmentation and 2D body pose estimation in video. We show results that provide\ninsightful knowledge to augment the clinician's behavioral observations\nobtained from real in-clinic assessments.\n",

        "summary": "  In this work, we present a new 3D face recognition method based on Speeded-Up\nLocal Descriptor (SULD) of significant points extracted from the range images\nof faces. The proposed model consists of a method for extracting distinctive\ninvariant features from range images of faces that can be used to perform\nreliable matching between different poses of range images of faces. For a given\n3D face scan, range images are computed and the potential interest points are\nidentified by searching at all scales. Based on the stability of the interest\npoint, significant points are extracted. For each significant point we compute\nthe SULD descriptor which consists of vector made of values from the convolved\nHaar wavelet responses located on concentric circles centred on the significant\npoint, and where the amount of Gaussian smoothing is proportional to the radii\nof the circles. Experimental results show that the newly proposed method\nprovides higher recognition rate compared to other existing contemporary models\ndeveloped for 3D face recognition.\n",

The thyroid\nnodule can be completely cured if detected early. Fine needle aspiration\ncytology is a recognized early diagnosis method of thyroid nodule. There are\nstill some limitations in the fine needle aspiration cytology, and the\nultrasound diagnosis of thyroid nodule has become the first choice for\nauxiliary examination of thyroid nodular disease. If we could combine medical\nimaging technology and fine needle aspiration cytology, the diagnostic rate of\nthyroid nodule would be improved significantly. The properties of ultrasound\nwill degrade the image quality, which makes it difficult to recognize the edges\nfor physicians. Image segmentation technique based on graph theory has become a\nresearch hotspot at present. Normalized cut (Ncut) is a representative one,\nwhich is suitable for segmentation of feature parts of medical image. However,\nhow to solve the normalized cut has become a problem, which needs large memory\ncapacity and heavy calculation of weight matrix. It always generates over\nsegmentation or less segmentation which leads to inaccurate in the\nsegmentation. The speckle noise in B ultrasound image of thyroid tumor makes\nthe quality of the image deteriorate. In the light of this characteristic, we\ncombine the anisotropic diffusion model with the normalized cut in this paper.\nAfter the enhancement of anisotropic diffusion model, it removes the noise in\nthe B ultrasound image while preserves the important edges and local details.\nThis reduces the amount of computation in constructing the weight matrix of the\nimproved normalized cut and improves the accuracy of the final segmentation\nresults.

A standard test images, the\nreal-world and synthetic images are used to compare the results of the proposed\nedge detector with the Baljit and Amar edge detector method. In order to\nvalidate the results, the run time of the proposed method and the pervious\nmethod are presented. It has been observed that the proposed edge detector\nworks effectively for different gray scale digital images. The performance\nevaluation of the proposed technique in terms of the measured CPU time and the\nquality of edge detector method are presented. Experimental results demonstrate\nthat the proposed method achieve better result than the relevant classic\nmethod.\n",

        "summary": "  Large high-dimensional datasets are becoming more and more popular in an\nincreasing number of research areas. Processing the high dimensional data\nincurs a high computational cost and is inherently inefficient since many of\nthe values that describe a data object are redundant due to noise and inner\ncorrelations. Consequently, the dimensionality, i.e. the number of values that\nare used to describe a data object, needs to be reduced prior to any other\nprocessing of the data. The dimensionality reduction removes, in most cases,\nnoise from the data and reduces substantially the computational cost of\nalgorithms that are applied to the data.\n  In this thesis, a novel coherent integrated methodology is introduced\n(theory, algorithm and applications) to reduce the dimensionality of\nhigh-dimensional datasets. The method constructs a diffusion process among the\ndata coordinates via a random walk. The dimensionality reduction is obtained\nbased on the eigen-decomposition of the Markov matrix that is associated with\nthe random walk. The proposed method is utilized for: (a) segmentation and\ndetection of anomalies in hyper-spectral images; (b) segmentation of\nmulti-contrast MRI images; and (c) segmentation of video sequences.\n  We also present algorithms for: (a) the characterization of materials using\ntheir spectral signatures to enable their identification; (b) detection of\nvehicles according to their acoustic signatures; and (c) classification of\nvascular vessels recordings to detect hyper-tension and cardio-vascular\ndiseases.\n  The proposed methodology and algorithms produce excellent results that\nsuccessfully compete with current state-of-the-art algorithms.\n",

        "summary": "  We present a method for recognition of isolated Swedish Sign Language signs.\nThe method will be used in a game intended to help children training signing at\nhome, as a complement to training with a teacher. The target group is not\nprimarily deaf children, but children with language disorders. Using sign\nlanguage as a support in conversation has been shown to greatly stimulate the\nspeech development of such children. The signer is captured with an RGB-D\n(Kinect) sensor, which has three advantages over a regular RGB camera. Firstly,\nit allows complex backgrounds to be removed easily. We segment the hands and\nface based on skin color and depth information. Secondly, it helps with the\nresolution of hand over face occlusion. Thirdly, signs take place in 3D; some\naspects of the signs are defined by hand motion vertically to the image plane.\nThis motion can be estimated if the depth is observable. The 3D motion of the\nhands relative to the torso are used as a cue together with the hand shape, and\nHMMs trained with this input are used for classification. To obtain higher\nrobustness towards differences across signers, Fisher Linear Discriminant\nAnalysis is used to find the combinations of features that are most descriptive\nfor each sign, regardless of signer. Experiments show that the system can\ndistinguish signs from a challenging 94 word vocabulary with a precision of up\nto 94% in the signer dependent case and up to 47% in the signer independent\ncase.\n",

Encoding rate control has thus to consider both texture and depth\ndata. Due to different structures of depth and texture images and their\ndifferent roles on the rendered views, distributing the available bit budget\nbetween them however requires a careful analysis. Information loss due to\ntexture coding affects the value of pixels in synthesized views while errors in\ndepth information lead to shift in objects or unexpected patterns at their\nboundaries. In this paper, we address the problem of efficient bit allocation\nbetween textures and depth data of multiview video sequences. We adopt a\nrate-distortion framework based on a simplified model of depth and texture\nimages. Our model preserves the main features of depth and texture images.\nUnlike most recent solutions, our method permits to avoid rendering at encoding\ntime for distortion estimation so that the encoding complexity is not\naugmented. In addition to this, our model is independent of the underlying\ninpainting method that is used at decoder. Experiments confirm our theoretical\nresults and the efficiency of our rate allocation strategy.\n",

Determining the Cobb angle through manual process is subject to\nhuman errors. In this work, we propose a methodology to measure the magnitude\nof Cobb angle, which appreciably reduces the variability related to its\nmeasurement compared to the related works. The proposed methodology is\nfacilitated by using a suitable new improved version of Non-Local Means for\nimage denoisation and Otsus automatic threshold selection for Canny edge\ndetection. We have selected NLM for preprocessing of the image as it is one of\nthe fine states of art for image denoisation and helps in retaining the image\nquality. Trimmedmean, median are more robust to outliners than mean and\nfollowing this concept we observed that NLM denoising quality performance can\nbe enhanced by using Euclidean trimmed-mean replacing the mean. To prove the\nbetter performance of the Non-Local Euclidean Trimmed-mean denoising filter, we\nhave provided some comparative study results of the proposed denoising\ntechnique with traditional NLM and NonLocal Euclidean Medians.

The\nproposed technique comprises a combination of four filters such as homomorphic\nfiltering, wavelet denoising, bilateral filter and contrast equalization. These\nfilters are applied sequentially on degraded underwater images. The literature\nsurvey reveals that image based preprocessing algorithms uses standard filter\ntechniques with various combinations. For smoothing the image, the image based\npreprocessing algorithms uses the anisotropic filter. The main drawback of the\nanisotropic filter is that iterative in nature and computation time is high\ncompared to bilateral filter. In the proposed technique, in addition to other\nthree filters, we employ a bilateral filter for smoothing the image. The\nexperimentation is carried out in two stages. In the first stage, we have\nconducted various experiments on captured images and estimated optimal\nparameters for bilateral filter. Similarly, optimal filter bank and optimal\nwavelet shrinkage function are estimated for wavelet denoising. In the second\nstage, we conducted the experiments using estimated optimal parameters, optimal\nfilter bank and optimal wavelet shrinkage function for evaluating the proposed\ntechnique. We evaluated the technique using quantitative based criteria such as\na gradient magnitude histogram and Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR).

        "summary": "  Skin colour detection is frequently been used for searching people, face\ndetection, pornographic filtering and hand tracking. The presence of skin or\nnon-skin in digital image can be determined by manipulating pixels colour or\npixels texture. The main problem in skin colour detection is to represent the\nskin colour distribution model that is invariant or least sensitive to changes\nin illumination condition. Another problem comes from the fact that many\nobjects in the real world may possess almost similar skin-tone colour such as\nwood, leather, skin-coloured clothing, hair and sand. Moreover, skin colour is\ndifferent between races and can be different from a person to another, even\nwith people of the same ethnicity. Finally, skin colour will appear a little\ndifferent when different types of camera are used to capture the object or\nscene. The objective in this study is to develop a skin colour classifier based\non pixel-based using RGB ratio model. The RGB ratio model is a newly proposed\nmethod that belongs under the category of an explicitly defined skin region\nmodel. This skin classifier was tested with SIdb dataset and two benchmark\ndatasets; UChile and TDSD datasets to measure classifier performance. The\nperformance of skin classifier was measured based on true positive (TF) and\nfalse positive (FP) indicator. This newly proposed model was compared with\nKovac, Saleh and Swift models. The experimental results showed that the RGB\nratio model outperformed all the other models in term of detection rate. The\nRGB ratio model is able to reduce FP detection that caused by reddish objects\ncolour as well as be able to detect darkened skin and skin covered by shadow.\n",

Therefore, manual slice-by-slice segmentations in\nmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data, which have been obtained at regular\nintervals, are performed. In contrast to this manual time consuming\nslice-by-slice segmentation process Slicer is an alternative which can be\nsignificantly faster and less user intensive. In this contribution, we compare\npure manual segmentations of ten pituitary adenomas with semi-automatic\nsegmentations under Slicer.

The foreground images differ from one observed image to another, and are\nused to model possible occlusions of the scene. The proposed reconstruction\nalgorithm estimates jointly the images and the transformation parameters from\nthe available multi-view measurements. The ideal solution of this multi-view\nimaging problem minimizes a non-convex functional, and the reconstruction\ntechnique is an alternating descent method built to minimize this functional.\nThe convergence of the proposed algorithm is studied, and conditions under\nwhich the sequence of estimated images and parameters converges to a critical\npoint of the non-convex functional are provided.

Traditionally, this distortion is measured\nfrom photographs of a flat pattern which contains aligned elements.\nNevertheless, it is nearly impossible to fabricate a very flat pattern and to\nvalidate its flatness. This fact limits the attainable measurable precisions.\nIn contrast, it is much easier to obtain physically very precise straight lines\nby tightly stretching good quality strings on a frame. Taking literally\n\"plumb-line methods\", we built a \"calibration harp\" instead of the classic flat\npatterns to obtain a high precision measurement tool, demonstrably reaching\n2/100 pixel precisions. The harp is complemented with the algorithms computing\nautomatically from harp photographs two different and complementary lens\ndistortion measurements. The precision of the method is evaluated on images\ncorrected by state-of-the-art distortion correction algorithms, and by popular\nsoftware. Three applications are shown: first an objective and reliable\nmeasurement of the result of any distortion correction. Second, the harp\npermits to control state-of-the art global camera calibration algorithms: It\npermits to select the right distortion model, thus avoiding internal\ncompensation errors inherent to these methods. Third, the method replaces\nmanual procedures in other distortion correction methods, makes them fully\nautomatic, and increases their reliability and precision.\n",

The hierarchical model\nfollows the natural organization of population data and the top level in the\nhierarchy provides a common frame of reference for multigroup shape analysis,\ne.g. classification and hypothesis testing. Unlike typical shape-modeling\napproaches, the proposed model is a generative model that defines a joint\ndistribution of object-boundary data and the shape-model variables.\nFurthermore, it naturally enforces optimal correspondences during the process\nof model fitting and thereby subsumes the so-called correspondence problem. The\nproposed inference scheme employs an expectation maximization (EM) algorithm\nthat treats the individual and group shape variables as hidden random variables\nand integrates them out before estimating the parameters (population mean and\nvariance and the group variances). The underpinning of the EM algorithm is the\nsampling of pointsets, in Kendall shape space, from their posterior\ndistribution, for which we exploit a highly-efficient scheme based on\nHamiltonian Monte Carlo simulation. Experiments in this paper use the fitted\nhierarchical model to perform (1) hypothesis testing for comparison between\npairs of groups using permutation testing and (2) classification for image\nretrieval.

In many applications, particularly those in\nvisual tracking, the unknown state can be split into a small dimensional part,\ne.g. global motion, and a spatial signal, e.g. illumination or shape\ndeformation. The spatial signal is often well modeled as being sparse in some\ndomain. For a long sequence, its sparsity pattern can change over time,\nalthough the changes are usually slow. To address the above problem, we propose\na novel solution approach called Particle Filtered Modified-CS (PaFiMoCS).

        "summary": "  In this thesis a new approach for touch detection on optical multi-touch\ndevices is proposed that exploits the fact that the camera images reveal not\nonly the actual touch points but also objects above the screen such as the hand\nor arm of a user. The touch processing relies on the Maximally Stable Extremal\nRegions algorithm for finding the users' fingertips in the camera image. The\nhierarchical structure of the generated extremal regions serves as a starting\npoint for agglomerative clustering of the fingertips into hands. Furthermore, a\nheuristic is suggested that supports the identification of individual fingers\nas well as the distinction between left hands and right hands if all five\nfingers of a hand are in contact with the touch surface.\n  The evaluation confirmed that the system is robust against detection errors\nresulting from non-uniform illumination and reliably assigns touch points to\nindividual hands based on the implicitly tracked context information. The\nefficient multi-threaded implementation handles two-handed input from multiple\nusers in real-time.\n",

For this purpose, a novel and efficient method is proposed to propagate\nMRF energies throughout the frames via bilateral filters without using any\nglobal texture, color or shape model.

Most existing works depend heavily on the outlier\nsegmentation to remove the outlier effect in the registration. Moreover, these\nworks do not handle simultaneously the missing correspondences and local large\ndeformations. In this paper, we defined the nonrigid image registration as a\nlocal adaptive kernel regression which locally reconstruct the moving image's\ndense deformation vectors from the sparse deformation vectors in the\nmulti-resolution block matching. The kernel function of the kernel regression\nadapts its shape and orientation to the reference image's structure to gather\nmore deformation vector samples of the same structure for the iterative\nregression computation, whereby the moving image's local deformations could be\ncompliant with the reference image's local structures. To estimate the local\ndeformations around the outliers, we use joint saliency map that highlights the\ncorresponding saliency structures (called Joint Saliency Structures, JSSs) in\nthe two images to guide the dense deformation reconstruction by emphasizing\nthose JSSs' sparse deformation vectors in the kernel regression.

In\nthis paper, a novel approach to suppress noise from the image is conducted by\napplying the interquartile range (IQR) which is one of the statistical methods\nused to detect outlier effect from a dataset. A window of size kXk was\nimplemented to support IQR filter. Each pixel outside the IQR range of the kXk\nwindow is treated as noisy pixel. The estimation of the noisy pixels was\nobtained by local averaging. The essential advantage of applying IQR filter is\nto preserve edge sharpness better of the original image. A variety of test\nimages have been used to support the proposed filter and PSNR was calculated\nand compared with median filter. The experimental results on standard test\nimages demonstrate this filter is simpler and better performing than median\nfilter.\n",

The cluster that has the highest peak which represents the\nmaximum frequency in the image histogram will play as an excellent role in\ndetermining a discerner cluster to the grey level image. Then, the pixels\nbelong to the discerner cluster represent an object in the gray level histogram\nwhile the other clusters represent a background.

We consider a typical multiscale registration setting where\nthe global 2-D translation between a pair of images is estimated by smoothing\nthe images and minimizing the distance between them with gradient descent. Our\nstudy particularly concentrates on the effect of noise and low-pass filtering\non the alignment accuracy. We adopt an analytic representation for images and\nanalyze the well-behavedness of the image distance function by estimating the\nneighborhood of translations for which it is free of undesired local minima.\nThis corresponds to the neighborhood of translation vectors that are correctly\ncomputable with a simple gradient descent minimization. We show that the area\nof this neighborhood increases at least quadratically with the smoothing filter\nsize, which justifies the use of a smoothing step in image registration with\nlocal optimizers such as gradient descent. We then examine the effect of noise\non the alignment accuracy and derive an upper bound for the alignment error in\nterms of the noise properties and filter size. Our main finding is that the\nerror increases at a rate that is at least linear with respect to the filter\nsize. Therefore, smoothing improves the well-behavedness of the distance\nfunction; however, this comes at the cost of amplifying the alignment error in\nnoisy settings. Our results provide a mathematical insight about why\nhierarchical techniques are effective in image registration, suggesting that\nthe multiscale coarse-to-fine alignment strategy of these techniques is very\nsuitable from the perspective of the trade-off between the well-behavedness of\nthe objective function and the registration accuracy.

In large scale face recognition systems, because the\nprobability of feature templates coming from different subjects is very high,\nmost of the matching pairs will be rejected by the early stages of the cascade.\nTherefore, the cascade can improve the matching speed significantly. On the\nother hand, using the nested structure of the cascade, we could drop some\nstages at the end of feature to reduce the memory and bandwidth usage in some\nresources intensive system while not sacrificing the performance too much. The\ncascade is learned by two steps. Firstly, some kind of prepared features are\ngrouped into several nested stages. And then, the threshold of each stage is\nlearned to achieve user defined verification rate (VR). In the paper, we take a\nlandmark based Gabor+LDA face recognition system as baseline to illustrate the\nprocess and advantages of the proposed method. However, the use of this method\nis very generic and not limited in face recognition, which can be easily\ngeneralized to other biometrics as a post-processing module.

        "summary": "  In the field of face recognition, Sparse Representation (SR) has received\nconsiderable attention during the past few years. Most of the relevant\nliterature focuses on holistic descriptors in closed-set identification\napplications. The underlying assumption in SR-based methods is that each class\nin the gallery has sufficient samples and the query lies on the subspace\nspanned by the gallery of the same class. Unfortunately, such assumption is\neasily violated in the more challenging face verification scenario, where an\nalgorithm is required to determine if two faces (where one or both have not\nbeen seen before) belong to the same person. In this paper, we first discuss\nwhy previous attempts with SR might not be applicable to verification problems.\nWe then propose an alternative approach to face verification via SR.\nSpecifically, we propose to use explicit SR encoding on local image patches\nrather than the entire face. The obtained sparse signals are pooled via\naveraging to form multiple region descriptors, which are then concatenated to\nform an overall face descriptor. Due to the deliberate loss spatial relations\nwithin each region (caused by averaging), the resulting descriptor is robust to\nmisalignment & various image deformations. Within the proposed framework, we\nevaluate several SR encoding techniques: l1-minimisation, Sparse Autoencoder\nNeural Network (SANN), and an implicit probabilistic technique based on\nGaussian Mixture Models. Thorough experiments on AR, FERET, exYaleB, BANCA and\nChokePoint datasets show that the proposed local SR approach obtains\nconsiderably better and more robust performance than several previous\nstate-of-the-art holistic SR methods, in both verification and closed-set\nidentification problems. The experiments also show that l1-minimisation based\nencoding has a considerably higher computational than the other techniques, but\nleads to higher recognition rates.\n",

        "summary": "  The aim of the paper is to separate handwritten and printed text from a real\ndocument embedded with noise, graphics including annotations. Relying on\nrun-length smoothing algorithm (RLSA), the extracted pseudo-lines and\npseudo-words are used as basic blocks for classification. To handle this, a\nmulti-class support vector machine (SVM) with Gaussian kernel performs a first\nlabelling of each pseudo-word including the study of local neighbourhood. It\nthen propagates the context between neighbours so that we can correct possible\nlabelling errors. Considering running time complexity issue, we propose linear\ncomplexity methods where we use k-NN with constraint. When using a kd-tree, it\nis almost linearly proportional to the number of pseudo-words. The performance\nof our system is close to 90%, even when very small learning dataset where\nsamples are basically composed of complex administrative documents.\n",

To help readers swiftly learn the\nrecent advances in 2D appearance models for visual object tracking, we\ncontribute this survey, which provides a detailed review of the existing 2D\nappearance models. In particular, this survey takes a module-based architecture\nthat enables readers to easily grasp the key points of visual object tracking.\nIn this survey, we first decompose the problem of appearance modeling into two\ndifferent processing stages: visual representation and statistical modeling.\nThen, different 2D appearance models are categorized and discussed with respect\nto their composition modules. Finally, we address several issues of interest as\nwell as the remaining challenges for future research on this topic. The\ncontributions of this survey are four-fold. First, we review the literature of\nvisual representations according to their feature-construction mechanisms\n(i.e., local and global). Second, the existing statistical modeling schemes for\ntracking-by-detection are reviewed according to their model-construction\nmechanisms: generative, discriminative, and hybrid generative-discriminative.\nThird, each type of visual representations or statistical modeling techniques\nis analyzed and discussed from a theoretical or practical viewpoint.

In this paper primarily discussed\nOn-line and Off-line handwriting recognition methods for Arabic words which are\noften used among then across the Middle East and North Africa People. Arabic\nword online handwriting recognition is a very challenging task due to its\ncursive nature. Because of the characteristic of the whole body of the Arabic\nscript, namely connectivity between the characters, thereby the segmentation of\nAn Arabic script is very difficult. In this paper we introduced an Arabic\nscript multiple classifier system for recognizing notes written on a Starboard.\nThis Arabic script multiple classifier system combines one off-line and on-line\nhandwriting recognition systems. The Arabic script recognizers are all based on\nHidden Markov Models but vary in the way of preprocessing and normalization. To\ncombine the Arabic script output sequences of the recognizers, we incrementally\nalign the word sequences using a norm string matching algorithm. The Arabic\nscript combination we could increase the system performance over the excellent\ncharacter recognizer by about 3%.

Nonetheless, there are many challenging problems arising in\ntraining cascade detectors. One common issue is that the node classifier is\ntrained with a symmetric classifier. Having a low misclassification error rate\ndoes not guarantee an optimal node learning goal in cascade classifiers, i.e.,\nan extremely high detection rate with a moderate false positive rate. In this\nwork, we present a new approach to train an effective node classifier in a\ncascade detector. The algorithm is based on two key observations: 1) Redundant\nweak classifiers can be safely discarded; 2) The final detector should satisfy\nthe asymmetric learning objective of the cascade architecture. To achieve this,\nwe separate the classifier training into two steps: finding a pool of\ndiscriminative weak classifiers/features and training the final classifier by\npruning weak classifiers which contribute little to the asymmetric learning\ncriterion (asymmetric classifier construction). Our model reduction approach\nhelps accelerate the learning time while achieving the pre-determined learning\nobjective.

In addition to being flexible in\ntheir ability to model different types of attributes, the presented kernels are\ncomputationally efficient and some of them can easily be computed for large\ndatasets (N of the order 10.000) of trees with 30-600 branches.

Using kernelized hypothesis testing we show\nthat the geometric airway trees are significantly differently distributed in\npatients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) than in healthy\nindividuals.

Learning is found to be most pronounced in three\nGabor-function parameters representing the size and spatial frequency of the\ntwo-dimensional Gabor function, and characterized by a non-uniform probability\ndistribution with heavy tails. All three parameters are found to be strongly\ncorrelated: resulting in a basis of multiscale Gabor functions with similar\naspect ratios, and size-dependent spatial frequencies. A key finding is that\nthe distribution of receptive-field sizes is scale-invariant over a wide range\nof values, so there is no characteristic receptive-field size selected by\nnatural image statistics. The Gabor-function aspect ratio is found to be\napproximately conserved by the learning rules and is therefore not\nwell-determined by natural image statistics. This allows for three distinct\nsolutions: a basis of Gabor functions with sharp orientation resolution at the\nexpense of spatial-frequency resolution; a basis of Gabor functions with sharp\nspatial-frequency resolution at the expense of orientation resolution; or a\nbasis with unit aspect ratio. Arbitrary mixtures of all three cases are also\npossible.

On the other hand various methods use textons to\nrepresent the texture, breaking texture down into its smallest unit. To tackle\nthis problem, we propose a method to identify texture patterns not small as\ntextons at distinct scales enhancing the separability among different types of\ntexture. We find sub patterns of texture according to the scale and then group\nsimilar patterns for a more refined analysis. Tests were performed in four\nstatic texture databases and one dynamic one.

        "summary": "  This paper proposes a novel method which combines both median filter and\nsimple standard deviation to accomplish an excellent edge detector for image\nprocessing. First of all, a denoising process must be applied on the grey scale\nimage using median filter to identify pixels which are likely to be\ncontaminated by noise. The benefit of this step is to smooth the image and get\nrid of the noisy pixels. After that, the simple statistical standard deviation\ncould be computed for each 2X2 window size. If the value of the standard\ndeviation inside the 2X2 window size is greater than a predefined threshold,\nthen the upper left pixel in the 2?2 window represents an edge. The visual\ndifferences between the proposed edge detector and the standard known edge\ndetectors have been shown to support the contribution in this paper.\n",

Given\nthat images shared online or created by individual users are taken with a wide\nrange of devices and may be processed by various post processing functions, to\nfind a robust object recognition system is useful and challenging. In this\npaper, we present the first study on the influence of picture styles for object\nrecognition, and propose an adaptive approach based on the kernel view of\ngradient descriptors and multiple kernel learning, without estimating or\nspecifying the styles of images used in training and testing.

The conventional\nsolutions of image enhancement are grouped into two categories which are\nspatial domain processing method and transform domain processing method such as\ncontrast manipulation, histogram equalization, homomorphic filtering. This\npaper proposes a new image enhance method based on dictionary learning.\nParticularly, the proposed method adjusts the image by manipulating the rarity\nof dictionary atoms. Firstly, learn the dictionary through sparse coding\nalgorithms on divided sub-image blocks. Secondly, compute the rarity of\ndictionary atoms on statistics of the corresponding sparse coefficients.\nThirdly, adjust the rarity according to specific application and form a new\ndictionary. Finally, reconstruct the image using the updated dictionary and\nsparse coefficients. Compared with the traditional techniques, the proposed\nmethod enhances image based on the image content not on distribution of pixel\ngrey value or frequency. The advantages of the proposed method lie in that it\nis in better correspondence with the response of the human visual system and\nmore suitable for salient objects extraction. The experimental results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed image enhance method.\n",

In this way we increase\nthe number of tested partitions and thus we potentially improve the\nsegmentation results.

        "summary": "  The paper investigates a hypothesis that our visual system groups visual cues\nbased on how they form a surface, or more specifically triangulation derived\nfrom the visual cues. To test our hypothesis, we compare shape recognition with\nthree different representations of visual cues: a set of isolated dots\ndelineating the outline of the shape, a set of triangles obtained from Delaunay\ntriangulation of the set of dots, and a subset of Delaunay triangles excluding\nthose outside of the shape. Each participant was assigned to one particular\nrepresentation type and increased the number of dots (and consequentially\ntriangles) until the underlying shape could be identified. We compare the\naverage number of dots needed for identification among three types of\nrepresentations. Our hypothesis predicts that the results from the three\nrepresentations will be similar. However, they show statistically significant\ndifferences. The paper also presents triangulation based algorithms for\nreconstruction and recognition of a shape from a set of isolated dots.\nExperiments showed that the algorithms were more effective and perceptually\nagreeable than similar contour based ones. From these experiments, we conclude\nthat triangulation does affect our shape recognition. However, the surface\nbased approach presents a number of computational advantages over the contour\nbased one and should be studied further.\n",

In this work, to leverage on these methods, an ensemble of experts\n(EoE) framework is introduced, to efficiently combine the outputs of various\nmethods. The proposed framework offers a new selection process of the\nbinarization methods, which are actually the experts in the ensemble, by\nintroducing three concepts: confidentness, endorsement and schools of experts.\nThe framework, which is highly objective, is built based on two general\nprinciples: (i) consolidation of saturated opinions and (ii) identification of\nschools of experts. After building the endorsement graph of the ensemble for an\ninput document image based on the confidentness of the experts, the saturated\nopinions are consolidated, and then the schools of experts are identified by\nthresholding the consolidated endorsement graph. A variation of the framework,\nin which no selection is made, is also introduced that combines the outputs of\nall experts using endorsement-dependent weights.

They are precious for simplifying gradient images or,\nfilling unwanted catchment basins, on which a subsequent watershed transform\nextracts the targeted objects. Flooding a topographic surface may be modeled as\nflooding a node weighted graph (TG), with unweighted edges, the node weights\nrepresenting the ground level. The progression of a flooding may also be\nmodeled on the region adjacency graph (RAG) of a topographic surface. On a RAG\neach node represents a catchment basin and edges connect neighboring nodes. The\nedges are weighted by the altitude of the pass point between both adjacent\nregions. The graph is flooded from sources placed at the marker positions and\neach node is assigned to the source by which it has been flooded. The level of\nthe flood is represented on the nodes on each type of graphs. The same flooding\nmay thus be modeled on a TG or on a RAG. We characterize all valid floodings on\nboth types of graphs, as they should verify the laws of hydrostatics. We then\nshow that each flooding of a node weighted graph also is a flooding of an edge\nweighted graph with appropriate edge weights. The highest flooding under a\nceiling function may be interpreted as the shortest distance to the root for\nthe ultrametric flooding distance in an augmented graph. The ultrametric\ndistance between two nodes is the minimal altitude of a flooding for which both\nnodes are flooded. This remark permits to flood edge or node weighted graphs by\nusing shortest path algorithms. It appears that the collection of all lakes of\na RAG has the structure of a dendrogram, on which the highest flooding under a\nceiling function may be rapidly found.\n",

Some of these challenges call for\nobject models that can locate a desired object and separate it from its\nsurrounding background, even when both share similar colors and textures. In\nthis work, we extend a fuzzy object model, named cloud system model (CSM), to\nhandle video segmentation, and evaluate it for body pose estimation of toddlers\nat risk of autism. CSM has been successfully used to model the parts of the\nbrain (cerebrum, left and right brain hemispheres, and cerebellum) in order to\nautomatically locate and separate them from each other, the connected brain\nstem, and the background in 3D MR-images. In our case, the objects are\narticulated parts (2D projections) of the human body, which can deform, cause\nself-occlusions, and move along the video. The proposed CSM extension handles\narticulation by connecting the individual clouds, body parts, of the system\nusing a 2D stickman model. The stickman representation naturally allows us to\nextract 2D body pose measures of arm asymmetry patterns during unsupported gait\nof toddlers, a possible behavioral marker of autism.

The aperture assembly consists of a two dimensional array of\naperture elements. The transmittance of each aperture element is independently\ncontrollable. The sensor is a single detection element. A compressive sensing\nmatrix is implemented by adjusting the transmittance of the individual aperture\nelements according to the values of the sensing matrix. The proposed\narchitecture is simple and reliable because no lens is used. The architecture\ncan be used for capturing images of visible and other spectra such as infrared,\nor millimeter waves, in surveillance applications for detecting anomalies or\nextracting features such as speed of moving objects. Multiple sensors may be\nused with a single aperture assembly to capture multi-view images\nsimultaneously. A prototype was built by using a LCD panel and a photoelectric\nsensor for capturing images of visible spectrum.\n",

        "summary": "  Hyperspectral unmixing is one of the crucial steps for many hyperspectral\napplications. The problem of hyperspectral unmixing has proven to be a\ndifficult task in unsupervised work settings where the endmembers and\nabundances are both unknown. What is more, this task becomes more challenging\nin the case that the spectral bands are degraded with noise. This paper\npresents a robust model for unsupervised hyperspectral unmixing. Specifically,\nour model is developed with the correntropy based metric where the non-negative\nconstraints on both endmembers and abundances are imposed to keep physical\nsignificance. In addition, a sparsity prior is explicitly formulated to\nconstrain the distribution of the abundances of each endmember. To solve our\nmodel, a half-quadratic optimization technique is developed to convert the\noriginal complex optimization problem into an iteratively re-weighted NMF with\nsparsity constraints. As a result, the optimization of our model can adaptively\nassign small weights to noisy bands and give more emphasis on noise-free bands.\nIn addition, with sparsity constraints, our model can naturally generate sparse\nabundances. Experiments on synthetic and real data demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our model in comparison to the related state-of-the-art\nunmixing models.\n",

        "summary": "  One of the fundamental requirements for visual surveillance using\nnon-overlapping camera networks is the correct labeling of tracked objects on\neach camera in a consistent way,in the sense that the captured tracklets, or\nobservations in this paper, of the same object at different cameras should be\nassigned with the same label. In this paper, we formulate this task as a\nBayesian inference problem and propose a distributed inference framework in\nwhich the posterior distribution of labeling variable corresponding to each\nobservation, conditioned on all history appearance and spatio-temporal evidence\nmade in the whole networks, is calculated based solely on local information\nprocessing on each camera and mutual information exchanging between neighboring\ncameras. In our framework, the number of objects presenting in the monitored\nregion, i.e. the sampling space of labeling variables, does not need to be\nspecified beforehand. Instead, it can be determined automatically on the fly.\nIn addition, we make no assumption about the appearance distribution of a\nsingle object, but use similarity scores between appearance pairs, given by\nadvanced object re-identification algorithm, as appearance likelihood for\ninference. This feature makes our method very flexible and competitive when\nobserving condition undergoes large changes across camera views. To cope with\nthe problem of missing detection, which is critical for distributed inference,\nwe consider an enlarged neighborhood of each camera during inference and use a\nmixture model to describe the higher order spatio-temporal constraints. The\nrobustness of the algorithm against missing detection is improved at the cost\nof slightly increased computation and communication burden at each camera node.\nFinally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through experiments on\nan indoor Office Building dataset and an outdoor Campus Garden dataset.\n",

While inherently insensitive to visible spectrum\nillumination changes, IR images introduce specific challenges of their own,\nmost notably sensitivity to factors which affect facial heat emission patterns,\ne.g. emotional state, ambient temperature, and alcohol intake. In addition,\nfacial expression and pose changes are more difficult to correct in IR images\nbecause they are less rich in high frequency detail which is an important cue\nfor fitting any deformable model. We describe a novel method which addresses\nthese challenges. To normalize for pose and facial expression changes we\ngenerate a synthetic frontal image of a face in a canonical, neutral facial\nexpression from an image of the face in an arbitrary pose and facial\nexpression. This is achieved by piecewise affine warping which follows active\nappearance model (AAM) fitting. This is the first publication which explores\nthe use of an AAM on thermal IR images; we propose a pre-processing step which\nenhances detail in thermal images, making AAM convergence faster and more\naccurate. To overcome the problem of thermal IR image sensitivity to the\npattern of facial temperature emissions we describe a representation based on\nreliable anatomical features. In contrast to previous approaches, our\nrepresentation is not binary; rather, our method accounts for the reliability\nof the extracted features. This makes the proposed representation much more\nrobust both to pose and scale changes.

In addition, facial\nexpression and pose changes are more difficult to correct in IR images because\nthey are less rich in high frequency detail which is an important cue for\nfitting any deformable model. In this paper we describe a novel method which\naddresses these major challenges.

Like CCA when applied to the\nmatching of sets, our extended canonical correlation analysis (E-CCA) aims to\nextract the most similar modes of variability within two sets. Our first major\ncontribution is the formulation of a principled framework for robust inference\nof such modes from data in the presence of uncertainty associated with noise\nand sampling randomness. E-CCA retains the efficiency and closed form\ncomputability of CCA, but unlike it, does not possess free parameters which\ncannot be inferred directly from data (inherent data dimensionality, and the\nnumber of canonical correlations used for set similarity computation). Our\nsecond major contribution is to show that in contrast to CCA, E-CCA is readily\nadapted to match sets in a discriminative learning scheme which we call\ndiscriminative extended canonical correlation analysis (DE-CCA). Theoretical\ncontributions of this paper are followed by an empirical evaluation of its\npremises on the task of face recognition from sets of rasterized appearance\nimages.

The aspects of the images that\nare captured by the learned features, which we call MDS features, completely\ndepend on what kind of image distance measurement is employed. With properly\nselected semantics-sensitive image distances, the MDS features provide rich\nsemantic information about the images that is not captured by other feature\nextraction techniques. In our work, we introduce the iterated\nLevenberg-Marquardt algorithm for solving MDS, and study the MDS feature\nlearning with IMage Euclidean Distance (IMED) and Spatial Pyramid Matching\n(SPM) distance. We present experiments on both synthetic data and real images\n--- the publicly accessible UIUC car image dataset. The MDS features based on\nSPM distance achieve exceptional performance for the car recognition task.\n",

        "summary": "  The problem of 3D object recognition is of immense practical importance, with\nthe last decade witnessing a number of breakthroughs in the state of the art.\nMost of the previous work has focused on the matching of textured objects using\nlocal appearance descriptors extracted around salient image points. The\nrecently proposed bag of boundaries method was the first to address directly\nthe problem of matching smooth objects using boundary features. However, no\nprevious work has attempted to achieve a holistic treatment of the problem by\njointly using textural and shape features which is what we describe herein. Due\nto the complementarity of the two modalities, we fuse the corresponding\nmatching scores and learn their relative weighting in a data specific manner by\noptimizing discriminative performance on synthetically distorted data. For the\ntextural description of an object we adopt a representation in the form of a\nhistogram of SIFT based visual words. Similarly the apparent shape of an object\nis represented by a histogram of discretized features capturing local shape. On\na large public database of a diverse set of objects, the proposed method is\nshown to outperform significantly both purely textural and purely shape based\napproaches for matching across viewpoint variation.\n",

        "summary": "  Typical blur from camera shake often deviates from the standard uniform\nconvolutional script, in part because of problematic rotations which create\ngreater blurring away from some unknown center point. Consequently, successful\nblind deconvolution requires the estimation of a spatially-varying or\nnon-uniform blur operator. Using ideas from Bayesian inference and convex\nanalysis, this paper derives a non-uniform blind deblurring algorithm with\nseveral desirable, yet previously-unexplored attributes. The underlying\nobjective function includes a spatially adaptive penalty which couples the\nlatent sharp image, non-uniform blur operator, and noise level together. This\ncoupling allows the penalty to automatically adjust its shape based on the\nestimated degree of local blur and image structure such that regions with large\nblur or few prominent edges are discounted. Remaining regions with modest blur\nand revealing edges therefore dominate the overall estimation process without\nexplicitly incorporating structure-selection heuristics. The algorithm can be\nimplemented using a majorization-minimization strategy that is virtually\nparameter free. Detailed theoretical analysis and empirical validation on real\nimages serve to validate the proposed method.\n",

We propose a Block-DCT and PCA based image perceptual hash in\nthis article and explore the algorithm in the application of tamper detection.\nThe main idea of the algorithm is to integrate color histogram and DCT\ncoefficients of image blocks as perceptual feature, then to compress perceptual\nfeatures as inter-feature with PCA, and to threshold to create a robust hash.\nThe robustness and discrimination properties of the proposed algorithm are\nevaluated in detail. Our algorithms first construct a secondary image, derived\nfrom input image by pseudo-randomly extracting features that approximately\ncapture semi-global geometric characteristics. From the secondary image (which\ndoes not perceptually resemble the input), we further extract the final\nfeatures which can be used as a hash value (and can be further suitably\nquantized). In this paper, we use spectral matrix invariants as embodied by\nSingular Value Decomposition. Surprisingly, formation of the secondary image\nturns out be quite important since it not only introduces further robustness,\nbut also enhances the security properties. Indeed, our experiments reveal that\nour hashing algorithms extract most of the geometric information from the\nimages and hence are robust to severe perturbations (e.g. up to %50 cropping by\narea with 20 degree rotations) on images while avoiding misclassification.\nExperimental results show that the proposed image perceptual hash algorithm can\neffectively address the tamper detection problem with advantageous robustness\nand discrimination.\n",

The method allows an HMM to model the sequence of poses of the event\nparticipants over time, and is effective for poses of humans and inanimate\nobjects.

In this way, classifiers trained on the sparse codes in the source\ndomain consisting of frontal faces for example can be applied to the target\ndomain (consisting of faces in different poses, illumination conditions, etc)\nwithout much loss in recognition accuracy. The approach is to first learn a\ndomain base dictionary, and then describe each domain shift (identity, pose,\nillumination) using a sparse representation over the base dictionary. The\ndictionary adapted to each domain is expressed as sparse linear combinations of\nthe base dictionary. In the context of face recognition, with the proposed\ncompositional dictionary approach, a face image can be decomposed into sparse\nrepresentations for a given subject, pose and illumination respectively. This\napproach has three advantages: first, the extracted sparse representation for a\nsubject is consistent across domains and enables pose and illumination\ninsensitive face recognition. Second, sparse representations for pose and\nillumination can subsequently be used to estimate the pose and illumination\ncondition of a face image. Finally, by composing sparse representations for\nsubject and the different domains, we can also perform pose alignment and\nillumination normalization.

The subspace clustering\nproblem has been extensively studied in the literature to partition such\nhigh-dimensional data into clusters corresponding to their underlying\nlow-dimensional subspaces. However, low-dimensional intrinsic structures are\noften violated for real-world observations, as they can be corrupted by errors\nor deviate from ideal models. We propose to address this by learning a linear\ntransformation on subspaces using matrix rank, via its convex surrogate nuclear\nnorm, as the optimization criteria.

        "summary": "  We present an approach for dictionary learning of action attributes via\ninformation maximization. We unify the class distribution and appearance\ninformation into an objective function for learning a sparse dictionary of\naction attributes. The objective function maximizes the mutual information\nbetween what has been learned and what remains to be learned in terms of\nappearance information and class distribution for each dictionary atom. We\npropose a Gaussian Process (GP) model for sparse representation to optimize the\ndictionary objective function. The sparse coding property allows a kernel with\ncompact support in GP to realize a very efficient dictionary learning process.\nHence we can describe an action video by a set of compact and discriminative\naction attributes. More importantly, we can recognize modeled action categories\nin a sparse feature space, which can be generalized to unseen and unmodeled\naction categories. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our\napproach in action recognition and summarization.\n",

Many algorithms have been\nintroduced to remove the noise from the natural images, such as Gaussian,\nWiener filtering and wavelet thresholding. However, many of these algorithms\nremove the fine edges and make them blur. Recently, many promising denoising\nalgorithms have been introduced such as Non-local Means, Fields of Experts, and\nBM3D. In this paper, we explore Bayesian method of ensemble learning for image\ndenoising. Ensemble methods seek to combine multiple different algorithms to\nretain the strengths of all methods and the weaknesses of none. Bayesian\nensemble models are Non-local Means and Fields of Experts, the very successful\nrecent algorithms. The Non-local Means presumes that the image contains an\nextensive amount of self-similarity. The approach of the Fields of Experts\nmodel extends traditional Markov Random Field model by learning potential\nfunctions over extended pixel neighborhoods. The two models are implemented and\nimage denoising is performed on natural images.

        "summary": "  Over the last decade, a number of Computational Imaging (CI) systems have\nbeen proposed for tasks such as motion deblurring, defocus deblurring and\nmultispectral imaging. These techniques increase the amount of light reaching\nthe sensor via multiplexing and then undo the deleterious effects of\nmultiplexing by appropriate reconstruction algorithms. Given the widespread\nappeal and the considerable enthusiasm generated by these techniques, a\ndetailed performance analysis of the benefits conferred by this approach is\nimportant.\n  Unfortunately, a detailed analysis of CI has proven to be a challenging\nproblem because performance depends equally on three components: (1) the\noptical multiplexing, (2) the noise characteristics of the sensor, and (3) the\nreconstruction algorithm. A few recent papers have performed analysis taking\nmultiplexing and noise characteristics into account. However, analysis of CI\nsystems under state-of-the-art reconstruction algorithms, most of which exploit\nsignal prior models, has proven to be unwieldy. In this paper, we present a\ncomprehensive analysis framework incorporating all three components.\n  In order to perform this analysis, we model the signal priors using a\nGaussian Mixture Model (GMM). A GMM prior confers two unique characteristics.\nFirstly, GMM satisfies the universal approximation property which says that any\nprior density function can be approximated to any fidelity using a GMM with\nappropriate number of mixtures. Secondly, a GMM prior lends itself to\nanalytical tractability allowing us to derive simple expressions for the\n`minimum mean square error' (MMSE), which we use as a metric to characterize\nthe performance of CI systems. We use our framework to analyze several\npreviously proposed CI techniques, giving conclusive answer to the question:\n`How much performance gain is due to use of a signal prior and how much is due\nto multiplexing?\n",

A good image quality assessment (IQA) model should\nnot only deliver high quality prediction accuracy but also be computationally\nefficient. The efficiency of IQA metrics is becoming particularly important due\nto the increasing proliferation of high-volume visual data in high-speed\nnetworks. We present a new effective and efficient IQA model, called gradient\nmagnitude similarity deviation (GMSD). The image gradients are sensitive to\nimage distortions, while different local structures in a distorted image suffer\ndifferent degrees of degradations. This motivates us to explore the use of\nglobal variation of gradient based local quality map for overall image quality\nprediction. We find that the pixel-wise gradient magnitude similarity (GMS)\nbetween the reference and distorted images combined with a novel pooling\nstrategy the standard deviation of the GMS map can predict accurately\nperceptual image quality.

In this paper, we propose a novel image set based\ncollaborative representation and classification method for ISFR.

State-of-the-art BIQA\nmethods typically require subjects to score a large number of images to train a\nrobust model. However, subjective quality scores are imprecise, biased, and\ninconsistent, and it is challenging to obtain a large scale database, or to\nextend existing databases, because of the inconvenience of collecting images,\ntraining the subjects, conducting subjective experiments, and realigning human\nquality evaluations. To combat these limitations, this paper explores and\nexploits preference image pairs (PIPs) such as \"the quality of image $I_a$ is\nbetter than that of image $I_b$\" for training a robust BIQA model. The\npreference label, representing the relative quality of two images, is generally\nprecise and consistent, and is not sensitive to image content, distortion type,\nor subject identity; such PIPs can be generated at very low cost. The proposed\nBIQA method is one of learning to rank. We first formulate the problem of\nlearning the mapping from the image features to the preference label as one of\nclassification. In particular, we investigate the utilization of a multiple\nkernel learning algorithm based on group lasso (MKLGL) to provide a solution. A\nsimple but effective strategy to estimate perceptual image quality scores is\nthen presented. Experiments show that the proposed BIQA method is highly\neffective and achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art BIQA\nalgorithms.

In this paper, we investigate\nthe effects of these phases by separating them for video-based action\nclassification. We compare several dictionary learning methods and feature\nencoding schemes through extensive experiments on KTH and HMDB51 datasets.\nExperimental results indicate that sparse coding performs consistently better\nthan the other encoding methods in large complex dataset (i.e., HMDB51), and it\nis robust to different dictionaries. For small simple dataset (i.e., KTH) with\nless variation, however, all the encoding strategies perform competitively. In\naddition, we note that the strength of sophisticated encoding approaches comes\nnot from their corresponding dictionaries but the encoding mechanisms, and we\ncan just use randomly selected exemplars as dictionaries for video-based action\nclassification.\n",

Blood perfusion data are\ncharacterized by the regional blood flow in human tissue and therefore do not\ndepend entirely on surrounding temperature. These data bear a great potential\nfor deriving discriminating facial thermogram for better classification and\nrecognition of face images in comparison to optical image data. Blood perfusion\ndata are related to distribution of blood vessels under the face skin.

There may be several such minutiae point sets for a\nsingle face but all of these correspond to that particular face only. Entire\nface image is partitioned into equal blocks and the total number of minutiae\npoints from each block is computed to construct final vector.

These temperature changes can be regarded as\ntexture features of images. A comparative study of face recognition methods\nworking in thermal spectrum is carried out in this paper. In these study two\nlocal-matching methods based on Haar wavelet transform and Local Binary Pattern\n(LBP) are analyzed. Wavelet transform is a good tool to analyze multi-scale,\nmulti-direction changes of texture. Local binary patterns (LBP) are a type of\nfeature used for classification in computer vision. Firstly, human thermal IR\nface image is preprocessed and cropped the face region only from the entire\nimage. Secondly, two different approaches are used to extract the features from\nthe cropped face region. In the first approach, the training images and the\ntest images are processed with Haar wavelet transform and the LL band and the\naverage of LH/HL/HH bands sub-images are created for each face image. Then a\ntotal confidence matrix is formed for each face image by taking a weighted sum\nof the corresponding pixel values of the LL band and average band. For LBP\nfeature extraction, each of the face images in training and test datasets is\ndivided into 161 numbers of sub images, each of size 8X8 pixels. For each such\nsub images, LBP features are extracted which are concatenated in row wise\nmanner. PCA is performed separately on the individual feature set for\ndimensionality reeducation.

A\nstructured representation of object locations as a list of $(x,y)$ pairs is a\nmore natural domain for object detection than the spatially unstructured\nrepresentation produced by classifiers. Furthermore, this formulation allows us\nto take advantage of the intuition that large areas of the background are\nuninteresting and it is not worth expending computational effort on them. This\nresults in a more scalable algorithm because it does not need to take measures\nto prevent the background data from swamping the foreground data such as\nsubsampling or applying an ad-hoc weighting to the pixels.

Objects\nliving or non-living emit different amounts of IR energy according to their\nbody temperature and characteristics. Humans are homoeothermic and hence\ncapable of maintaining constant temperature under different surrounding\ntemperature. Face recognition from thermal (IR) images should focus on changes\nof temperature on facial blood vessels. These temperature changes can be\nregarded as texture features of images and wavelet transform is a very good\ntool to analyze multi-scale and multi-directional texture. Wavelet transform is\nalso used for image dimensionality reduction, by removing redundancies and\npreserving original features of the image. The sizes of the facial images are\nnormally large. So, the wavelet transform is used before image similarity is\nmeasured. Therefore this paper describes an efficient approach of human face\nrecognition based on wavelet transform from thermal IR images. The system\nconsists of three steps. At the very first step, human thermal IR face image is\npreprocessed and the face region is only cropped from the entire image.\nSecondly, Haar wavelet is used to extract low frequency band from the cropped\nface region.

        "summary": "  Low-rank matrix completion is a problem of immense practical importance.\nRecent works on the subject often use nuclear norm as a convex surrogate of the\nrank function. Despite its solid theoretical foundation, the convex version of\nthe problem often fails to work satisfactorily in real-life applications. Real\ndata often suffer from very few observations, with support not meeting the\nrandom requirements, ubiquitous presence of noise and potentially gross\ncorruptions, sometimes with these simultaneously occurring.\n  This paper proposes a Proximal Alternating Robust Subspace Minimization\n(PARSuMi) method to tackle the three problems. The proximal alternating scheme\nexplicitly exploits the rank constraint on the completed matrix and uses the\n$\\ell_0$ pseudo-norm directly in the corruption recovery step. We show that the\nproposed method for the non-convex and non-smooth model converges to a\nstationary point. Although it is not guaranteed to find the global optimal\nsolution, in practice we find that our algorithm can typically arrive at a good\nlocal minimizer when it is supplied with a reasonably good starting point based\non convex optimization. Extensive experiments with challenging synthetic and\nreal data demonstrate that our algorithm succeeds in a much larger range of\npractical problems where convex optimization fails, and it also outperforms\nvarious state-of-the-art algorithms.\n",

Salient face features, such as the eyes and nose, are\ndetected through an analysis of the curvature of the entire facial surface. All\nthe experiments have been performed on the FRAV3D Database. After applying the\nproposed algorithm to the 3D facial surface we have obtained considerably good\nresults i.e. on 752 3D face images our method detected the eye corners for 543\nface images, thus giving a 72.20% of eye corners detection and 743 face images\nfor nose-tip detection thus giving a 98.80% of good nose tip localization\n",

        "summary": "  In this paper, we present an algorithm for identifying a parametrically\ndescribed destructive unknown system based on a non-gaussianity measure. It is\nknown that under certain conditions the output of a linear system is more\ngaussian than the input. Hence, an inverse filter is searched, such that its\noutput is minimally gaussian. We use the kurtosis as a measure of the\nnon-gaussianity of the signal. A maximum of the kurtosis as a function of the\ndeconvolving filter coefficients is searched. The search is done iteratively\nusing the gradient ascent algorithm, and the coefficients at the maximum point\ncorrespond to the inverse filter coefficients. This filter may be applied to\nthe distorted signal to obtain the original undistorted signal. While a similar\napproach has been used before, it was always directed at a particular kind of a\nsignal, commonly of impulsive characteristics. In this paper a successful\nattempt has been made to apply the algorithm to a wider range of signals, such\nas to process distorted audio signals and destructed images. This innovative\nimplementation required the revelation of a way to preprocess the distorted\nsignal at hand. The experimental results show very good performance in terms of\nrecovering audio signals and blurred images, both for an FIR and IIR distorting\nfilters.\n",

This\nsurprising and prominent result suggests that those advances in generic image\nclassification can be directly applied to improve face recognition systems. In\nother words, face recognition may not need to be viewed as a separate object\nclassification problem.\n  While recently a large body of residual based face recognition methods focus\non developing complex dictionary learning algorithms, in this work we show that\na dictionary of randomly extracted patches (even from non-face images) can\nachieve very promising results using the image classification pipeline. That\nmeans, the choice of dictionary learning methods may not be important. Instead,\nwe find that learning multiple dictionaries using different low-level image\nfeatures often improve the final classification accuracy. Our proposed face\nrecognition approach offers the best reported results on the widely-used face\nrecognition benchmark datasets. In particular, on the challenging FERET and\nLFW-a datasets, we improve the best reported accuracies in the literature by\nabout 20% and 30% respectively.\n",

The BFOR framework provides the representation of mDWI in the\nq-space and thus reduces memory requirement. In addition, since the BFOR signal\nbasis is orthonormal, the L2 norm that quantifies the differences in the\nq-space signals of any two mDWI datasets can be easily computed as the sum of\nthe squared differences in the BFOR expansion coefficients. In this work, we\nshow that the reorientation of the $q$-space signal due to spatial\ntransformation can be easily defined on the BFOR signal basis. We incorporate\nthe BFOR signal basis into the LDDMM framework and derive the gradient descent\nalgorithm for LDDMM-HYDI with explicit orientation optimization.

Motivated by the\nneed to consider the widely varying forms of natural text, we propose a\nbottom-up approach to the problem which reflects the `characterness' of an\nimage region. In this sense our approach mirrors the move from saliency\ndetection methods to measures of `objectness'. In order to measure the\ncharacterness we develop three novel cues that are tailored for character\ndetection, and a Bayesian method for their integration. Because text is made up\nof sets of characters, we then design a Markov random field (MRF) model so as\nto exploit the inherent dependencies between characters.\n  We experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of our characterness cues as\nwell as the advantage of Bayesian multi-cue integration. The proposed text\ndetector outperforms state-of-the-art methods on a few benchmark scene text\ndetection datasets.

Mammograms\ngenerally suffer from a problem of different tissue overlapping which results\nin the possibility of inaccurate detection of tissue types. Fibroglandular\ntissue presents rather high attenuation of X-rays and is visible as brighter in\nthe resulting image but overlapping fibrous tissue and blood vessels could\neasily be replaced with fibroglandular tissue in automatic segmentation\nalgorithms. Small blood vessels and microcalcifications are also shown as\nbright objects with similar intensities as dense tissue but do have some\nproperties which makes possible to suppress them from the final results. In\nthis paper we try to divide dense and fat tissue by suppressing the scattered\nstructures which do not represent glandular or dense tissue in order to divide\nmammograms more accurately in the two major tissue types. For suppressing blood\nvessels and microcalcifications we have used Gabor filters of different size\nand orientation and a combination of morphological operations on filtered image\nwith enhanced contrast.\n",

        "title": "Flexible Visual Quality Inspection in Discrete Manufacturing",
        "summary": "  Most visual quality inspections in discrete manufacturing are composed of\nlength, surface, angle or intensity measurements. Those are implemented as\nend-user configurable inspection tools that should not require an image\nprocessing expert to set up. Currently available software solutions providing\nsuch capability use a flowchart based programming environment, but do not fully\naddress an inspection flowchart robustness and can require a redefinition of\nthe flowchart if a small variation is introduced. In this paper we propose an\nacquire-register-analyze image processing pattern designed for discrete\nmanufacturing that aims to increase the robustness of the inspection flowchart\nby consistently addressing variations in product position, orientation and\nsize. A proposed pattern is transparent to the end-user and simplifies the\nflowchart. We describe a developed software solution that is a practical\nimplementation of the proposed pattern. We give an example of its real-life use\nin industrial production of electric components.\n",

        "summary": "  In this paper the use of Random Sprays Retinex (RSR) algorithm for global\nillumination estimation is proposed and its feasibility tested. Like other\nalgorithms based on the Retinex model, RSR also provides local illumination\nestimation and brightness adjustment for each pixel and it is faster than other\npath-wise Retinex algorithms. As the assumption of the uniform illumination\nholds in many cases, it should be possible to use the mean of local\nillumination estimations of RSR as a global illumination estimation for images\nwith (assumed) uniform illumination allowing also the accuracy to be easily\nmeasured. Therefore we propose a method for estimating global illumination\nestimation based on local RSR results. To our best knowledge this is the first\ntime that RSR algorithm is used to obtain global illumination estimation. For\nour tests we use a publicly available color constancy image database for\ntesting. The results are presented and discussed and it turns out that the\nproposed method outperforms many existing unsupervised color constancy\nalgorithms.

The STA descriptors are local\nhistogram-based descriptors of space-time, suitable for building a partial\nrepresentation of arbitrary spatio-temporal phenomena. Because of the\npossibility of iterative refinement, they are interesting in the context of\nonline human action recognition. We investigate the use of dense optical flow\nas the image function of the STA descriptor for human action recognition, using\ntwo different algorithms for computing the flow: the Farneb\\\"ack algorithm and\nthe TVL1 algorithm. We provide a detailed analysis of the influencing optical\nflow algorithm parameters on the produced optical flow fields. An extensive\nexperimental validation of optical flow-based STA descriptors in human action\nrecognition is performed on the KTH human action dataset. The encouraging\nexperimental results suggest the potential of our approach in online human\naction recognition.\n",

The main idea behind this\napproach is that road signs from different foreground variations can share\nfeatures that discriminate them from backgrounds. The classification function\ntraining is accomplished using SVM, thus feature sharing is obtained through\nsupport vector sharing. Training yields a family of linear detectors, where\neach detector corresponds to a specific foreground training sample. The\nredundancy among detectors is alleviated using k-medoids clustering. Finally,\nwe report detection and classification results on a set of road sign images\nobtained from a camera on a moving vehicle.\n",

We\nevaluate the suitability of the GIST descriptor as a representation of these\nimages, first by exploring the descriptor space using PCA and k-means\nclustering, and then by using an SVM classifier and recording its 10-fold\ncross-validation performance on the introduced FM1 dataset.
