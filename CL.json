We exploit the capability of this logic to talk about the truth\nstatus of formulae to define a notion of coherence between utterances and\nexplain how this coherence relation can serve for the construction of AND/OR\ntrees that represent the segmentation of the dialog. In a BDI model we\nformalize basic assumptions about dialog and cooperative behaviour of\nparticipants. These assumptions provide a basis for inferring speech acts from\ncoherence relations between utterances and attitudes of dialog participants.\nSpeech acts prove to be useful for determining dialog segments defined on the\nnotion of completing expectations of dialog participants. Finally, we sketch\nhow explicit segmentation signalled by cue phrases and performatives is covered\nby our dialog model.\n",

        "summary": "  Language models for speech recognition typically use a probability model of\nthe form Pr(a_n | a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n-1}). Stochastic grammars, on the other\nhand, are typically used to assign structure to utterances. A language model of\nthe above form is constructed from such grammars by computing the prefix\nprobability Sum_{w in Sigma*} Pr(a_1 ... a_n w), where w represents all\npossible terminations of the prefix a_1 ... a_n. The main result in this paper\nis an algorithm to compute such prefix probabilities given a stochastic Tree\nAdjoining Grammar (TAG). The algorithm achieves the required computation in\nO(n^6) time. The probability of subderivations that do not derive any words in\nthe prefix, but contribute structurally to its derivation, are precomputed to\nachieve termination. This algorithm enables existing corpus-based estimation\ntechniques for stochastic TAGs to be used for language modelling.\n",

        "summary": "  Much of the power of probabilistic methods in modelling language comes from\ntheir ability to compare several derivations for the same string in the\nlanguage. An important starting point for the study of such cross-derivational\nproperties is the notion of _consistency_. The probability model defined by a\nprobabilistic grammar is said to be _consistent_ if the probabilities assigned\nto all the strings in the language sum to one. From the literature on\nprobabilistic context-free grammars (CFGs), we know precisely the conditions\nwhich ensure that consistency is true for a given CFG. This paper derives the\nconditions under which a given probabilistic Tree Adjoining Grammar (TAG) can\nbe shown to be consistent. It gives a simple algorithm for checking consistency\nand gives the formal justification for its correctness. The conditions derived\nhere can be used to ensure that probability models that use TAGs can be checked\nfor _deficiency_ (i.e. whether any probability mass is assigned to strings that\ncannot be generated).\n",

We employ a gradual,\ninformation-based concept of ``unknownness'' providing a uniform treatment for\nthe range of completely known to maximally unknown lexical entries. ``Unknown''\ninformation is viewed as revisable information, which is either generalizable\nor specializable. Updating takes place after parsing, which only requires a\nmodified lexical lookup. Revisable pieces of information are identified by\ngrammar-specified declarations which provide access paths into the parse\nfeature structure. The updating mechanism revises the corresponding places in\nthe lexical feature structures iff the context actually provides new\ninformation. For revising generalizable information, type union is required. A\nworked-out example demonstrates the inferential capacity of our implemented\nsystem.\n",

The system and model were developed primarily on one set of data,\nand then applied later to a much more complex data set, to assess the\ngeneralizability of the model for the task being performed. Many different\ntypes of empirical methods are applied to pinpoint the strengths and weaknesses\nof the approach. Detailed annotation instructions were developed and an\nintercoder reliability study was performed, showing that naive annotators can\nreliably perform the targeted annotations. A fully automatic system has been\ndeveloped and evaluated on unseen test data, with good results on both data\nsets. We adopt a pure realization of a recency-based focus model to identify\nprecisely when it is and is not adequate for the task being addressed. In\naddition to system results, an in-depth evaluation of the model itself is\npresented, based on detailed manual annotations. The results are that few\nerrors occur specifically due to the model of focus being used, and the set of\nanaphoric relations defined in the model are low in ambiguity for both data\nsets.\n",

While such a grammar is easy to obtain, a\nsquare-root rate of growth of the rule set with corpus size suggests that the\nderived grammar is far from complete and that much more treebanked text would\nbe required to obtain a complete grammar, if one exists at some limit. However,\nwe offer an alternative explanation in terms of the underspecification of\nstructures within the treebank. This hypothesis is explored by applying an\nalgorithm to compact the derived grammar by eliminating redundant rules --\nrules whose right hand sides can be parsed by other rules. The size of the\nresulting compacted grammar, which is significantly less than that of the full\ntreebank grammar, is shown to approach a limit. However, such a compacted\ngrammar does not yield very good performance figures. A version of the\ncompaction algorithm taking rule probabilities into account is proposed, which\nis argued to be more linguistically motivated. Combined with simple\nthresholding, this method can be used to give a 58% reduction in grammar size\nwithout significant change in parsing performance, and can produce a 69%\nreduction with some gain in recall, but a loss in precision.\n",

(a) and (b) both share the wrong belief that to a word must\ncorrespond a simple entity that is its meaning. I then turn to the semantic\nrules that Pustejovsky uses and argue first that, although they have novel\nfeatures, they are in a well-established Artificial Intelligence tradition of\nexplaining meaning by reference to structures that mention other structures\nassigned to words that may occur in close proximity to the first. It is argued\nthat Fodor and Lepore's view that there cannot be such rules is without\nfoundation, and indeed systems using such rules have proved their practical\nworth in computational systems. Their justification descends from line of\nargument, whose high points were probably Wittgenstein and Quine that meaning\nis not to be understood by simple links to the world, ostensive or otherwise,\nbut by the relationship of whole cultural representational structures to each\nother and to the world as a whole.\n",

        "summary": "  `Linguistic annotation' covers any descriptive or analytic notations applied\nto raw language data. The basic data may be in the form of time functions --\naudio, video and/or physiological recordings -- or it may be textual. The added\nnotations may include transcriptions of all sorts (from phonetic features to\ndiscourse structures), part-of-speech and sense tagging, syntactic analysis,\n`named entity' identification, co-reference annotation, and so on. While there\nare several ongoing efforts to provide formats and tools for such annotations\nand to publish annotated linguistic databases, the lack of widely accepted\nstandards is becoming a critical problem. Proposed standards, to the extent\nthey exist, have focussed on file formats. This paper focuses instead on the\nlogical structure of linguistic annotations. We survey a wide variety of\nexisting annotation formats and demonstrate a common conceptual core, the\nannotation graph. This provides a formal framework for constructing,\nmaintaining and searching linguistic annotations, while remaining consistent\nwith many alternative data structures and file formats.\n",

        "summary": "  Recent technological advances have made it possible to build real-time,\ninteractive spoken dialogue systems for a wide variety of applications.\nHowever, when users do not respect the limitations of such systems, performance\ntypically degrades. Although users differ with respect to their knowledge of\nsystem limitations, and although different dialogue strategies make system\nlimitations more apparent to users, most current systems do not try to improve\nperformance by adapting dialogue behavior to individual users. This paper\npresents an empirical evaluation of TOOT, an adaptable spoken dialogue system\nfor retrieving train schedules on the web. We conduct an experiment in which 20\nusers carry out 4 tasks with both adaptable and non-adaptable versions of TOOT,\nresulting in a corpus of 80 dialogues. The values for a wide range of\nevaluation measures are then extracted from this corpus. Our results show that\nadaptable TOOT generally outperforms non-adaptable TOOT, and that the utility\nof adaptation depends on TOOT's initial dialogue strategies.\n",

Utterances in a dialogue\nare modelled as steps in a plan where understanding an utterance involves\nderiving the complete plan a speaker is attempting to achieve. However,\nprevious speech act based approaches have been limited by a reliance upon\nrelatively simplistic belief modelling techniques and their relationship to\nplanning and plan recognition.

In addition, Japanese often represents loanwords based on\nits phonogram. Consequently, existing dictionaries find it difficult to achieve\nsufficient coverage. To counter the first problem, we use a compound word\ntranslation method, which uses a bilingual dictionary for base words and\ncollocational statistics to resolve translation ambiguity.

We define two methods for creating an\ninventory of templates and using them to generate new LTRs. A simpler method\nconsists of extracting a finite set of templates from a sample of hand coded\nLTRs and directly using them in the generation process. A further method\nconsists of abstracting over the initial finite set of templates to define\nhigher level templates, where bilingual equivalences are defined in terms of\ncorrespondences involving phrasal categories. Phrasal templates are then mapped\nonto sets of lexical templates with the aid of grammars. In this way an\ninfinite set of lexical templates is recursively defined. New LTRs are created\nby parsing input words, matching a template at the phrasal level and using the\ncorresponding lexical categories to instantiate the lexical template.

The system progressively collects\nexamples by selecting those with greatest utility. The paper reports the\neffectiveness of our method through experiments on about one thousand\nsentences. Compared to experiments with other example sampling methods, our\nmethod reduced both the overhead for supervision and the overhead for search,\nwithout the degeneration of the performance of the system.\n",

        "title": "One-Level Prosodic Morphology",
        "summary": "  Recent developments in theoretical linguistics have lead to a widespread\nacceptance of constraint-based analyses of prosodic morphology phenomena such\nas truncation, infixation, floating morphemes and reduplication. Of these,\nreduplication is particularly challenging for state-of-the-art computational\nmorphology, since it involves copying of some part of a phonological string. In\nthis paper I argue for certain extensions to the one-level model of phonology\nand morphology (Bird & Ellison 1994) to cover the computational aspects of\nprosodic morphology using finite-state methods. In a nutshell, enriched lexical\nrepresentations provide additional automaton arcs to repeat or skip sounds and\nalso to allow insertion of additional material. A kind of resource\nconsciousness is introduced to control this additional freedom, distinguishing\nbetween producer and consumer arcs. The non-finite-state copying aspect of\nreduplication is mapped to automata intersection, itself a non-finite-state\noperation. Bounded local optimization prunes certain automaton arcs that fail\nto contribute to linguistic optimisation criteria. The paper then presents\nimplemented case studies of Ulwa construct state infixation, German\nhypocoristic truncation and Tagalog over-applying reduplication that illustrate\nthe expressive power of this approach, before its merits and limitations are\ndiscussed and possible extensions are sketched. I conclude that the one-level\napproach to prosodic morphology presents an attractive way of extending\nfinite-state techniques to difficult phenomena that hitherto resisted elegant\ncomputational analyses.\n",

        "summary": "  A noun phrase can indirectly refer to an entity that has already been\nmentioned. For example, ``I went into an old house last night. The roof was\nleaking badly and ...'' indicates that ``the roof'' is associated with `` an\nold house}'', which was mentioned in the previous sentence. This kind of\nreference (indirect anaphora) has not been studied well in natural language\nprocessing, but is important for coherence resolution, language understanding,\nand machine translation. In order to analyze indirect anaphora, we need a case\nframe dictionary for nouns that contains knowledge of the relationships between\ntwo nouns but no such dictionary presently exists. Therefore, we are forced to\nuse examples of ``X no Y'' (Y of X) and a verb case frame dictionary instead.\nWe tried estimating indirect anaphora using this information and obtained a\nrecall rate of 63% and a precision rate of 68% on test sentences. This\nindicates that the information of ``X no Y'' is useful to a certain extent when\nwe cannot make use of a noun case frame dictionary. We estimated the results\nthat would be given by a noun case frame dictionary, and obtained recall and\nprecision rates of 71% and 82% respectively. Finally, we proposed a way to\nconstruct a noun case frame dictionary by using examples of ``X no Y.''\n",

Information about the usage of grammar rules in test\nsentences is used to detect untested rules, redundant test sentences, and\nlikely causes of overgeneration. Results show that less than half of a\nlarge-coverage grammar for German is actually tested by two large testsuites,\nand that 10-30% of testing time is redundant. The methodology applied can be\nseen as a re-use of grammar writing knowledge for testsuite compilation.\n",

An answer extraction system locates the exact phrases in the documents\nthat contain the explicit answers to the user queries. Answer extraction\nsystems are therefore more convenient than document retrieval systems in\nsituations where the user wants to find specific information in limited time.\n  ExtrAns performs answer extraction over UNIX manpages. It has been\nconstructed by combining available linguistic resources and implementing only a\nfew modules from scratch. A resolution procedure between the minimal logical\nform of the user query and the minimal logical forms of the manpage sentences\nfinds the answers to the queries. These answers are displayed to the user,\ntogether with pointers to the respective manpages, and the exact phrases that\ncontribute to the answer are highlighted.\n  This paper shows that the increase in response times is not a big issue when\nscaling the system up from 30 to 500 documents, and that the response times for\n500 documents are still acceptable for a real-time answer extraction system.\n",

This thesis is concerned with\napproaches for capitalizing on this situation in a sample problem domain, Penn\nTreebank-style parsing.\n  The machine learning community provides techniques for combining outputs of\nclassifiers, but parser output is more structured and interdependent than\nclassifications. To address this discrepancy, two novel strategies for\ncombining parsers are used: learning to control a switch between parsers and\nconstructing a hybrid parse from multiple parsers' outputs.\n  Off-the-shelf parsers are not developed with an intention to perform well in\na collaborative ensemble. Two techniques are presented for producing an\nensemble of parsers that collaborate. All of the ensemble members are created\nusing the same underlying parser induction algorithm, and the method for\nproducing complementary parsers is only loosely constrained by that chosen\nalgorithm.\n",

Sometimes this goal is covering\na corpus; sometimes the developers have theoretical ideas they wish to\ninvestigate; most often, work is driven by a combination of these two main\ntypes of goal. What tends to happen after a while is that the community of\npeople working with the grammar starts thinking of some phenomena as\n``central'', and makes serious efforts to deal with them; other phenomena are\nlabelled ``marginal'', and ignored. Before long, the distinction between\n``central'' and ``marginal'' becomes so ingrained that it is automatic, and\npeople virtually stop thinking about the ``marginal'' phenomena. In practice,\nthe only way to bring the marginal things back into focus is to look at what\nother people are doing and compare it with one's own work. In this paper, we\nwill take two large grammars, XTAG and the CLE, and examine each of them from\nthe other's point of view. We will find in both cases not only that important\nthings are missing, but that the perspective offered by the other grammar\nsuggests simple and practical ways of filling in the holes. It turns out that\nthere is a pleasing symmetry to the picture. XTAG has a very good treatment of\ncomplement structure, which the CLE to some extent lacks; conversely, the CLE\noffers a powerful and general account of adjuncts, which the XTAG grammar does\nnot fully duplicate. If we examine the way in which each grammar does the thing\nit is good at, we find that the relevant methods are quite easy to port to the\nother framework, and in fact only involve generalization and systematization of\nexisting mechanisms.\n",

The dialogue\nmodel is based on treating the discourse structure of a conversation as a\nhidden Markov model and the individual dialogue acts as observations emanating\nfrom the model states. Constraints on the likely sequence of dialogue acts are\nmodeled via a dialogue act n-gram. The statistical dialogue grammar is combined\nwith word n-grams, decision trees, and neural networks modeling the\nidiosyncratic lexical and prosodic manifestations of each dialogue act.

This study asks whether current\napproaches, which use mainly word information, could be improved by adding\nprosodic information. The study is based on more than 1000 conversations from\nthe Switchboard corpus. DAs were hand-annotated, and prosodic features\n(duration, pause, F0, energy, and speaking rate) were automatically extracted\nfor each DA. In training, decision trees based on these features were inferred;\ntrees were then applied to unseen test data to evaluate performance.\nPerformance was evaluated for prosody models alone, and after combining the\nprosody models with word information -- either from true words or from the\noutput of an automatic speech recognizer. For an overall classification task,\nas well as three subtasks, prosody made significant contributions to\nclassification. Feature-specific analyses further revealed that although\ncanonical features (such as F0 for questions) were important, less obvious\nfeatures could compensate if canonical features were removed. Finally, in each\ntask, integrating the prosodic model with a DA-specific statistical language\nmodel improved performance over that of the language model alone, especially\nfor the case of recognized words. Results suggest that DAs are redundantly\nmarked in natural conversation, and that a variety of automatically extractable\nprosodic features could aid dialog processing in speech applications.\n",

The relative\nentropy measure can be expressed as a relative change in training set\nperplexity. This leads to a simple pruning criterion whereby all N-grams that\nchange perplexity by less than a threshold are removed from the model.\nExperiments show that a production-quality Hub4 LM can be reduced to 26% its\noriginal size without increasing recognition error. We also compare the\napproach to a heuristic pruning criterion by Seymore and Rosenfeld (1996), and\nshow that their approach can be interpreted as an approximation to the relative\nentropy criterion.

Speech segmentation is challenging, since the cues typically\npresent for segmenting text (headers, paragraphs, punctuation) are absent in\nspoken language. We investigate the use of prosody (information gleaned from\nthe timing and melody of speech) for these tasks. Using decision tree and\nhidden Markov modeling techniques, we combine prosodic cues with word-based\napproaches, and evaluate performance on two speech corpora, Broadcast News and\nSwitchboard. Results show that the prosodic model alone performs on par with,\nor better than, word-based statistical language models -- for both true and\nautomatically recognized words in news speech. The prosodic model achieves\ncomparable performance with significantly less training data, and requires no\nhand-labeling of prosodic events. Across tasks and corpora, we obtain a\nsignificant improvement over word-only models using a probabilistic combination\nof prosodic and lexical information. Inspection reveals that the prosodic\nmodels capture language-independent boundary indicators described in the\nliterature. Finally, cue usage is task and corpus dependent. For example, pause\nand pitch features are highly informative for segmenting news speech, whereas\npause, duration and word-based cues dominate for natural conversation.\n",

        "summary": "  Formal language techniques have been used in the past to study autonomous\ndynamical systems. However, for controlled systems, new features are needed to\ndistinguish between information generated by the system and input control. We\nshow how the modelling framework for controlled dynamical systems leads\nnaturally to a formulation in terms of context-dependent grammars. A learning\nalgorithm is proposed for on-line generation of the grammar productions, this\nformulation being then used for modelling, control and anomaly detection.\nPractical applications are described for electromechanical drives. Grammatical\ninterpolation techniques yield accurate results and the pattern detection\ncapabilities of the language-based formulation makes it a promising technique\nfor the early detection of anomalies or faulty behaviour.\n",

        "summary": "  Constraint-based grammars can, in principle, serve as the major linguistic\nknowledge source for both parsing and generation. Surface generation starts\nfrom input semantics representations that may vary across grammars. For many\ndeclarative grammars, the concept of derivation implicitly built in is that of\nparsing. They may thus not be interpretable by a generation algorithm. We show\nthat linguistically plausible semantic analyses can cause severe problems for\nsemantic-head-driven approaches for generation (SHDG). We use SeReal, a variant\nof SHDG and the DISCO grammar of German as our source of examples. We propose a\nnew, general approach that explicitly accounts for the interface between the\ngrammar and the generation algorithm by adding a control-oriented layer to the\nlinguistic knowledge base that reorganizes the semantics in a way suitable for\ngeneration.\n",

The first approach, called\nquantitative constraint logic programming, is conceptualized in a clear logical\nframework, and presents a sound and complete system of quantitative inference\nfor definite clauses annotated with subjective weights. This approach combines\na rigorous formal semantics for quantitative inference based on subjective\nweights with efficient weight-based pruning for constraint-based systems. The\nsecond approach, called probabilistic constraint logic programming, introduces\na log-linear probability distribution on the proof trees of a constraint logic\nprogram and an algorithm for statistical inference of the parameters and\nproperties of such probability models from incomplete, i.e., unparsed data. The\npossibility of defining arbitrary properties of proof trees as properties of\nthe log-linear probability model and efficiently estimating appropriate\nparameter values for them permits the probabilistic modeling of arbitrary\ncontext-dependencies in constraint logic programs. The usefulness of these\nideas is evaluated empirically in a small-scale experiment on finding the\ncorrect parses of a constraint-based grammar. In addition, we address the\nproblem of computational intractability of the calculation of expectations in\nthe inference task and present various techniques to approximately solve this\ntask.

We solve the problem by using surface expressions and\nexamples. Surface expressions are the words in sentences which provide clues\nfor anaphora resolution. Examples are linguistic data which are actually used\nin conversations and texts. The method using surface expressions and examples\nis a practical method. This thesis handles almost all kinds of anaphora: i. The\nreferential property and number of a noun phrase ii. Noun phrase direct\nanaphora iii. Noun phrase indirect anaphora iv. Pronoun anaphora v.

In this paper we complement this work in two ways.\nFirst, we provide an entailment relation for a language with ambiguous\nexpressions. Second, we give a sound and complete tableaux calculus for\nreasoning with statements involving ambiguous quantification. The calculus\ninterleaves partial disambiguation steps with steps in a traditional deductive\nprocess, so as to minimize and postpone branching in the proof process, and\nthereby increases its efficiency.\n",

We change the\nstandard problem formulation by replacing global search over a large set of\nsentence hypotheses with local search over a small set of word candidates. In\naddition to improving the accuracy of the recognizer, our method produces a new\nrepresentation of the set of candidate hypotheses that specifies the sequence\nof word-level confusions in a compact lattice format.

The final goal of our\nresearch is to enrich the Basque Lexical Database with semantic information\nsuch as senses, definitions, semantic relations, etc., extracted from a Basque\nmonolingual dictionary. The work here presented focuses on the extraction of\nthe semantic relations that best characterise the headword, that is, those of\nsynonymy, antonymy, hypernymy, and other relations marked by specific relators\nand derivation. All nominal, verbal and adjectival entries were treated. Basque\nuses morphological inflection to mark case, and therefore semantic relations\nhave to be inferred from suffixes rather than from prepositions. Our approach\ncombines a morphological analyser and surface syntax parsing (based on\nConstraint Grammar), and has proven very successful for highly inflected\nlanguages such as Basque. Both the effort to write the rules and the actual\nprocessing time of the dictionary have been very low. At present we have\nextracted 42,533 relations, leaving only 2,943 (9%) definitions without any\nextracted relation. The error rate is extremely low, as only 2.2% of the\nextracted relations are wrong.\n",

In this\npaper, we describe a uniform approach to microplanning based on declarative\nrepresentations of a generator's communicative intent. These representations\ndescribe the results of NLG: communicative intent associates the concrete\nlinguistic structure planned by the generator with inferences that show how the\nmeaning of that structure communicates needed information about some\napplication domain in the current discourse context. Our approach, implemented\nin the SPUD (sentence planning using description) microplanner, uses the\nlexicalized tree-adjoining grammar formalism (LTAG) to connect structure to\nmeaning and uses modal logic programming to connect meaning to context. At the\nsame time, communicative intent representations provide a resource for the\nprocess of NLG. Using representations of communicative intent, a generator can\naugment the syntax, semantics and pragmatics of an incomplete sentence\nsimultaneously, and can assess its progress on the various problems of\nmicroplanning incrementally. The declarative formulation of communicative\nintent translates into a well-defined methodology for designing grammatical and\nconceptual resources which the generator can use to achieve desired\nmicroplanning behavior in a specified domain.\n",

The same trick can be\nused to speed training of other machine learning techniques, e.g. neural\nnetworks, applied to any problem with a large number of outputs, such as\nlanguage modeling.\n",

We\nconclude by sketching out a lexicalised grammar for discourse that facilitates\ndiscourse interpretation as a product of compositional rules, anaphor\nresolution and inference.\n",

Compared to an HMM, this FST cascade has\nthe advantage of significantly higher processing speed, but at the cost of\nslightly lower accuracy. Applications such as Information Retrieval, where the\nspeed can be more important than accuracy, could benefit from this approach.\n  In the process of tagging, we first assign every word a unique ambiguity\nclass c_i that can be looked up in a lexicon encoded by a sequential FST. Every\nc_i is denoted by a single symbol, e.g. [ADJ_NOUN], although it represents a\nset of alternative tags that a given word can occur with. The sequence of the\nc_i of all words of one sentence is the input to our FST cascade. It is mapped\nby T1, from left to right, to a sequence of reduced ambiguity classes r_i.\nEvery r_i is denoted by a single symbol, although it represents a set of\nalternative tags. Intuitively, T1 eliminates the less likely tags from c_i,\nthus creating r_i. Finally, T2 maps the sequence of r_i, from right to left, to\na sequence of single POS tags t_i. Intuitively, T2 selects the most likely t_i\nfrom every r_i.\n  The probabilities of all t_i, r_i, and c_i are used only at compile time, not\nat run time. They do not (directly) occur in the FSTs, but are \"implicitly\ncontained\" in their structure.\n",

        "summary": "  Given the lack of word delimiters in written Japanese, word segmentation is\ngenerally considered a crucial first step in processing Japanese texts. Typical\nJapanese segmentation algorithms rely either on a lexicon and syntactic\nanalysis or on pre-segmented data; but these are labor-intensive, and the\nlexico-syntactic techniques are vulnerable to the unknown word problem. In\ncontrast, we introduce a novel, more robust statistical method utilizing\nunsegmented training data. Despite its simplicity, the algorithm yields\nperformance on long kanji sequences comparable to and sometimes surpassing that\nof state-of-the-art morphological analyzers over a variety of error metrics.\nThe algorithm also outperforms another mostly-unsupervised statistical\nalgorithm previously proposed for Chinese.\n  Additionally, we present a two-level annotation scheme for Japanese to\nincorporate multiple segmentation granularities, and introduce two novel\nevaluation metrics, both based on the notion of a compatible bracket, that can\naccount for multiple granularities simultaneously.\n",

We\ncurrently target the retrieval of technical documents, and therefore the\nperformance of our system is highly dependent on the quality of the translation\nof technical terms. However, the technical term translation is still\nproblematic in that technical terms are often compound words, and thus new\nterms are progressively created by combining existing base words. In addition,\nJapanese often represents loanwords based on its special phonogram.\nConsequently, existing dictionaries find it difficult to achieve sufficient\ncoverage. To counter the first problem, we produce a Japanese/English\ndictionary for base words, and translate compound words on a word-by-word\nbasis. We also use a probabilistic method to resolve translation ambiguity. For\nthe second problem, we use a transliteration method, which corresponds words\nunlisted in the base word dictionary to their phonetic equivalents in the\ntarget language.

        "summary": "  Robert French has argued that a disembodied computer is incapable of passing\na Turing Test that includes subcognitive questions. Subcognitive questions are\ndesigned to probe the network of cultural and perceptual associations that\nhumans naturally develop as we live, embodied and embedded in the world. In\nthis paper, I show how it is possible for a disembodied computer to answer\nsubcognitive questions appropriately, contrary to French's claim. My approach\nto answering subcognitive questions is to use statistical information extracted\nfrom a very large collection of text. In particular, I show how it is possible\nto answer a sample of subcognitive questions taken from French, by issuing\nqueries to a search engine that indexes about 350 million Web pages. This\nsimple algorithm may shed light on the nature of human (sub-) cognition, but\nthe scope of this paper is limited to demonstrating that French is mistaken: a\ndisembodied computer can answer subcognitive questions.\n",

For a sentence in the\nsource language text, the proposed algorithm picks the most likely translation\nfrom the target language text using lexical information and certain heuristics.\nIt does not do statistical analysis using sentence lengths. The algorithm is\nlanguage independent. It also aids in detecting addition and deletion of text\nin translations.

This is done by blindly\nrescaling the cepstral time series by a non-linear function, with the form of\nthis scale function being determined by previously encountered cepstra from\nthat channel. The rescaled form of the time series is an invariant property of\nit in the following sense: it is unaffected if the time series is transformed\nby any time-independent invertible distortion. Because a linear channel with\nstationary noise and impulse response transforms cepstra in this way, the new\ntechnique can be used to remove the channel dependence of a cepstral time\nseries. In experiments, the method achieved greater channel-independence than\ncepstral mean normalization, and it was comparable to the combination of\ncepstral mean normalization and spectral subtraction, despite the fact that no\nmeasurements of channel noise or reverberations were required (unlike spectral\nsubtraction).\n",

To enable parallel factorization, which allows a model\nevent to be resolved in more than one ways at the same time, we propose a\ngeneral framework, where we adopt a backing-off lattice to reflect parallel\nfactorizations and to define the paths along which a model is resolved into\nfactored models, we use a mixture model to combine parallel paths in the\nlattice, and generalize Katz's backing-off method to integrate all the mixture\nmodels got by traversing the entire lattice.

Then, the\npredication can be made according to the category distribution among these k\nnearest neighbors. Generally speaking, the class distribution in the training\nset is uneven. Some classes may have more samples than others. Therefore, the\nsystem performance is very sensitive to the choice of the parameter k. And it\nis very likely that a fixed k value will result in a bias on large categories.\nTo deal with these problems, we propose an improved kNN algorithm, which uses\ndifferent numbers of nearest neighbors for different categories, rather than a\nfixed number across all categories. More samples (nearest neighbors) will be\nused for deciding whether a test document should be classified to a category,\nwhich has more samples in the training set. Preliminary experiments on Chinese\ntext categorization show that our method is less sensitive to the parameter k\nthan the traditional one, and it can properly classify documents belonging to\nsmaller classes with a large k. The method is promising for some cases, where\nestimating the parameter k via cross-validation is not allowed.\n",

Users can easily formulate queries by using the textbook associated\nwith a target lecture, even if they cannot come up with effective keywords. Our\nsystem extracts the audio track from a target lecture video, generates a\ntranscription by large vocabulary continuous speech recognition, and produces a\ntext index. Experimental results showed that by adapting speech recognition to\nthe topic of the lecture, the recognition accuracy increased and the retrieval\naccuracy was comparable with that obtained by human transcription.\n",

        "summary": "  Spoken Language can be used to provide insights into organisational\nprocesses, unfortunately transcription and coding stages are very time\nconsuming and expensive. The concept of partial transcription and coding is\nproposed in which spoken language is indexed prior to any subsequent\nprocessing. The functional linguistic theory of texture is used to describe the\neffects of partial transcription on observational records. The standard used to\nencode transcript context and metadata is called CHAT, but a previous XML\nschema developed to implement it contains design assumptions that make it\ndifficult to support partial transcription for example. This paper describes a\nmore effective XML schema that overcomes many of these problems and is intended\nfor use in applications that support the rapid development of spoken language\ndeliverables.\n",

This concept\nhierarchy is used to generate a synthetic representation of the document by\naggregating the words present in topically homogeneous document segments into a\nset of concepts best preserving the document's content.\n  This new extraction technique uses an unexplored approach to topic selection.\nInstead of using semantic similarity measures based on a semantic resource, the\nlater is processed to extract the part of the conceptual hierarchy relevant to\nthe document content. Then this conceptual hierarchy is searched to extract the\nmost relevant set of concepts to represent the topics discussed in the\ndocument. Notice that this algorithm is able to extract generic concepts that\nare not directly present in the document.\n",

One of the main difficulties with\ninversion is that the problem is underdetermined and inversion methods\ngenerally offer no guarantee on the phonetical realism of the inverse\nsolutions. A way to adress this issue is to use additional phonetic\nconstraints. Knowledge of the phonetic caracteristics of French vowels enable\nthe derivation of reasonable articulatory domains in the space of Maeda\nparameters: given the formants frequencies (F1,F2,F3) of a speech sample, and\nthus the vowel identity, an \"ideal\" articulatory domain can be derived. The\nspace of formants frequencies is partitioned into vowels, using either\nspeaker-specific data or generic information on formants. Then, to each\narticulatory vector can be associated a phonetic score varying with the\ndistance to the \"ideal domain\" associated with the corresponding vowel.\nInversion experiments were conducted on isolated vowels and vowel-to-vowel\ntransitions. Articulatory parameters were compared with those obtained without\nusing these constraints and those measured from X-ray data.\n",

        "summary": "  In this paper we propose some new measures of language development using\nnetwork analyses, which is inspired by the recent surge of interests in network\nstudies of many real-world systems. Children's and care-takers' speech data\nfrom a longitudinal study are represented as a series of networks, word forms\nbeing taken as nodes and collocation of words as links. Measures on the\nproperties of the networks, such as size, connectivity, hub and authority\nanalyses, etc., allow us to make quantitative comparison so as to reveal\ndifferent paths of development. For example, the asynchrony of development in\nnetwork size and average degree suggests that children cannot be simply\nclassified as early talkers or late talkers by one or two measures. Children\nfollow different paths in a multi-dimensional space. They may develop faster in\none dimension but slower in another dimension. The network approach requires\nlittle preprocessing of words and analyses on sentence structures, and the\ncharacteristics of words and their usage emerge from the network and are\nindependent of any grammatical presumptions. We show that the change of the two\narticles \"the\" and \"a\" in their roles as important nodes in the network\nreflects the progress of children's syntactic development: the two articles\noften start in children's networks as hubs and later shift to authorities,\nwhile they are authorities constantly in the adult's networks. The network\nanalyses provide a new approach to study language development, and at the same\ntime language development also presents a rich area for network theories to\nexplore.\n",

The\nresource described in this paper contains English source texts (parliamentary\nproceedings) and their German translations. The shift annotation is based on\npredicate-argument structures and proceeds in two steps: first, predicates and\ntheir arguments are annotated monolingually in a straightforward manner.

One\nis to study networks existing in the language system. Various lexical networks\ncan be built based on different relationships between words, being semantic or\nsyntactic. Recent studies have shown that these lexical networks exhibit\nsmall-world and scale-free features. The other direction of exploration is to\nstudy networks of language users (i.e. social networks of people in the\nlinguistic community), and their role in language evolution. Social networks\nalso show small-world and scale-free features, which cannot be captured by\nrandom or regular network models. In the past, computational models of language\nchange and language emergence often assume a population to have a random or\nregular structure, and there has been little discussion how network structures\nmay affect the dynamics. In the second part of the paper, a series of\nsimulation models of diffusion of linguistic innovation are used to illustrate\nthe importance of choosing realistic conditions of population structure for\nmodeling language change. Four types of social networks are compared, which\nexhibit two categories of diffusion dynamics. While the questions about which\ntype of networks are more appropriate for modeling still remains, we give some\npreliminary suggestions for choosing the type of social networks for modeling.\n",

Taking a look into more practical issues, the paper examines how to\nbuild a net from the projection of syntactic relations. Recall that, as opposed\nto adult grammars, early-child language has not a well-defined concept of\nstructure. To overcome such difficulty, we develop a set of systematic criteria\nassuming constituency hierarchy and a grammar based on lexico-thematic\nrelations. At the end, what we obtain is a well defined corpora annotation that\nenables us i) to perform statistics on the size of structures and ii) to build\na network from syntactic relations over which we can perform the standard\nmeasures of complexity. We also provide a detailed example.\n",

In\na previous paper (Afantenos et al. 2007) we have presented a methodology for\nthe automatic summarization of documents, emitted by multiple sources, which\ndescribe the evolution of an event. At the heart of this methodology lies the\nidentification of similarities and differences between the various documents,\nin two axes: the synchronic and the diachronic. This is achieved by the\nintroduction of the notion of Synchronic and Diachronic Relations. Those\nrelations connect the messages that are found in the documents, resulting thus\nin a graph which we call grid. Although the creation of the grid completes the\nDocument Planning phase of a typical NLG architecture, it can be the case that\nthe number of messages contained in a grid is very large, exceeding thus the\nrequired compression rate. In this paper we provide some initial thoughts on a\nprobabilistic model which can be applied at the Content Determination stage,\nand which tries to alleviate this problem.\n",

Semantic similarity is here\nviewed as association. It turns out that the similarity between two words W1\nand W2 strongly increases with a co-occurrence, decreases with the occurrence\nof W1 without W2 or W2 without W1, and slightly increases with high-order\nco-occurrences. Therefore, operationalizing similarity as a frequency of\nco-occurrence probably introduces a bias: first, there are cases in which there\nis similarity without co-occurrence and, second, the frequency of co-occurrence\noverestimates similarity.\n",

The small size of the corpus, the absence of bilingual texts, and the\nlack of definite knowledge of the underlying language has frustrated efforts at\ndecipherment since the discovery of the remains of the Indus civilisation.\nRecently, some researchers have questioned the premise that the Indus script\nencodes spoken language. Building on previous statistical approaches, we apply\nthe tools of statistical language processing, specifically $n$-gram Markov\nchains, to analyse the Indus script for syntax. Our main results are that the\nscript has well-defined signs which begin and end texts, that there is\ndirectionality and strong correlations in the sign order, and that there are\ngroups of signs which appear to have identical syntactic function. All these\nrequire no {\\it a priori} suppositions regarding the syntactic or semantic\ncontent of the signs, but follow directly from the statistical analysis. Using\ninformation theoretic measures, we find the information in the script to be\nintermediate between that of a completely random and a completely fixed\nordering of signs. Our study reveals that the Indus script is a structured sign\nsystem showing features of a formal language, but, at present, cannot\nconclusively establish that it encodes {\\it natural} language. Our $n$-gram\nMarkov model is useful for predicting signs which are missing or illegible in a\ncorpus of Indus texts. This work forms the basis for the development of a\nstochastic grammar which can be used to explore the syntax of the Indus script\nin greater detail.\n",

        "summary": "  A standard form of analysis for linguistic typology is the universal\nimplication. These implications state facts about the range of extant\nlanguages, such as ``if objects come after verbs, then adjectives come after\nnouns.'' Such implications are typically discovered by painstaking hand\nanalysis over a small sample of languages. We propose a computational model for\nassisting at this process. Our model is able to discover both well-known\nimplications as well as some novel implications that deserve further study.\nMoreover, through a careful application of hierarchical analysis, we are able\nto cope with the well-known sampling problem: languages are not independent.\n",

        "title": "Induction of Word and Phrase Alignments for Automatic Document\n  Summarization",
        "summary": "  Current research in automatic single document summarization is dominated by\ntwo effective, yet naive approaches: summarization by sentence extraction, and\nheadline generation via bag-of-words models. While successful in some tasks,\nneither of these models is able to adequately capture the large set of\nlinguistic devices utilized by humans when they produce summaries. One possible\nexplanation for the widespread use of these models is that good techniques have\nbeen developed to extract appropriate training data for them from existing\ndocument/abstract and document/headline corpora. We believe that future\nprogress in automatic summarization will be driven both by the development of\nmore sophisticated, linguistically informed models, as well as a more effective\nleveraging of document/abstract corpora. In order to open the doors to\nsimultaneously achieving both of these goals, we have developed techniques for\nautomatically producing word-to-word and phrase-to-phrase alignments between\ndocuments and their human-written abstracts. These alignments make explicit the\ncorrespondences that exist in such document/abstract pairs, and create a\npotentially rich data source from which complex summarization algorithms may\nlearn. This paper describes experiments we have carried out to analyze the\nability of humans to perform such alignments, and based on these analyses, we\ndescribe experiments for creating them automatically. Our model for the\nalignment task is based on an extension of the standard hidden Markov model,\nand learns to create alignments in a completely unsupervised fashion. We\ndescribe our model in detail and present experimental results that show that\nour model is able to learn to reliably identify word- and phrase-level\nalignments in a corpus of <document,abstract> pairs.\n",

The work explores the\nperformance difference obtained in applying an ANN-based dynamic segmentation\nalgorithm compared to projection- based static segmentation. The algorithm\ninvolves, first training of an ANN with individual handwritten characters\nrecorded from different individuals. Handwritten sentences are separated out\nfrom text using a static segmentation method. From the segmented line,\nindividual characters are separated out by first over segmenting the entire\nline. Each of the segments thus obtained, next, is fed to the trained ANN. The\npoint of segmentation at which the ANN recognizes a segment or a combination of\nseveral segments to be similar to a handwritten character, a segmentation\nboundary for the character is assumed to exist and segmentation performed.

        "summary": "  This paper presents a theoretical research based approach to ellipsis\nresolution in machine translation. The formula of discourse is applied in order\nto resolve ellipses. The validity of the discourse formula is analyzed by\napplying it to the real world text, i.e., newspaper fragments. The source text\nis converted into mono-sentential discourses where complex discourses require\nfurther dissection either directly into primitive discourses or first into\ncompound discourses and later into primitive ones. The procedure of dissection\nneeds further improvement, i.e., discovering as many primitive discourse forms\nas possible. An attempt has been made to investigate new primitive discourses\nor patterns from the given text.\n",

In a Machine Translation (MT) system it\nis unlikely to have a complete lexicon and hence there is intense need of a new\nmechanism to handle the problem of unidentified words. These unknown words\ncould be abbreviations, names, acronyms and newly introduced terms. We have\nproposed an algorithm for the resolution of the unidentified words. This\nalgorithm takes discourse unit (primitive discourse) as a unit of analysis and\nprovides real time updates to the lexicon. We have manually applied the\nalgorithm to news paper fragments. Along with anaphora and cataphora\nresolution, many unknown words especially names and abbreviations were updated\nto the lexicon.\n",

It has been shown in the speech\nrecognition literature that parameter estimation using the current MMI\nparadigm, lattice-based MMI, consistently outperforms maximum likelihood\nestimation, but this is at the expense of undesirable convergence properties.\nIn particular, recognition performance is sensitive to the number of times that\nthe iterative MMI estimation algorithm, extended Baum-Welch, is performed. In\nfact, too many iterations of extended Baum-Welch will lead to degraded\nperformance, despite the fact that the MMI criterion improves at each\niteration. This phenomenon is at variance with the analogous behavior of\nmaximum likelihood estimation -- at least for the HMMs used in speech\nrecognition -- and it has previously been attributed to `over fitting'. In this\npaper, we present an analysis of lattice-based MMI that demonstrates, first of\nall, that the asymptotic behavior of lattice-based MMI is much worse than was\npreviously understood, i.e. it does not appear to converge at all, and, second\nof all, that this is not due to `over fitting'. Instead, we demonstrate that\nthe `over fitting' phenomenon is the result of standard methodology that\nexacerbates the poor behavior of two key approximations in the lattice-based\nMMI machinery. We also demonstrate that if we modify the standard methodology\nto improve the validity of these approximations, then the convergence\nproperties of lattice-based MMI become benign without sacrificing improvements\nto recognition accuracy.\n",

It is a potential scheme\nto offer spectral efficiency and robust high data rate transmissions over\nfrequency-selective fading channel. However, space-time coding impairs the\nsystem ability to suppress interferences as the signals transmitted from two\ntransmit antennas are superposed and interfered at the receiver antennas. In\nthis paper, we developed an adaptive beamforming based on least mean squared\nerror algorithm and null deepening to combat co-channel interference (CCI) for\nthe space-time coded OFDM (STC-OFDM) system. To illustrate the performance of\nthe presented approach, it is compared to the null steering beamformer which\nrequires a prior knowledge of directions of arrival (DOAs). The structure of\nspace-time decoders are preserved although there is the use of beamformers\nbefore decoding. By incorporating the proposed beamformer as a CCI canceller in\nthe STC-OFDM systems, the performance improvement is achieved as shown in the\nsimulation results.\n",

        "summary": "  Hidden Markov models (HMMs) have been successfully applied to automatic\nspeech recognition for more than 35 years in spite of the fact that a key HMM\nassumption -- the statistical independence of frames -- is obviously violated\nby speech data. In fact, this data/model mismatch has inspired many attempts to\nmodify or replace HMMs with alternative models that are better able to take\ninto account the statistical dependence of frames. However it is fair to say\nthat in 2010 the HMM is the consensus model of choice for speech recognition\nand that HMMs are at the heart of both commercially available products and\ncontemporary research systems. In this paper we present a preliminary\nexploration aimed at understanding how speech data depart from HMMs and what\neffect this departure has on the accuracy of HMM-based speech recognition. Our\nanalysis uses standard diagnostic tools from the field of statistics --\nhypothesis testing, simulation and resampling -- which are rarely used in the\nfield of speech recognition. Our main result, obtained by novel manipulations\nof real and resampled data, demonstrates that real data have statistical\ndependency and that this dependency is responsible for significant numbers of\nrecognition errors. We also demonstrate, using simulation and resampling, that\nif we `remove' the statistical dependency from data, then the resulting\nrecognition error rates become negligible. Taken together, these results\nsuggest that a better understanding of the structure of the statistical\ndependency in speech data is a crucial first step towards improving HMM-based\nspeech recognition.\n",

We propose a\nformal system accounting for the properties highlighted by the linguistic\nanalysis, and we use these tools for representing the semantic content of\nseveral spatial relations of French. The first part presents a semantic\nanalysis of the expression of space in French aiming at describing the\nconstraints that formal representations have to take into account. In the\nsecond part, after presenting the structure of our formal system, we set out\nits components. A commonsense geometry is sketched out and several functional\nand pragmatic spatial concepts are formalized. We take a special attention in\nshowing that these concepts are well suited to representing the semantic\ncontent of several prepositions of French ('sur' (on), 'dans' (in), 'devant'\n(in front of), 'au-dessus' (above)), and in illustrating the inferential\nadequacy of these representations.\n",

Descriptive and experimental\nstudies first propose a classification of entities, which accounts for both\nstatic and dynamic space, has some cross-linguistic validity, and underlies\nadults' cognitive processing. Formal and computational analyses then introduce\ntheoretical elements aiming at modelling these categories, while fulfilling\nvarious properties of formal ontologies (generality, parsimony, coherence...).\nThis formal framework accounts, in particular, for functional dependences among\nentities underlying some part-whole descriptions. Finally, developmental\nresearch shows that language-specific properties have a clear impact on how\nchildren talk about space. The results suggest some cross-linguistic\nvariability in children's spatial representations from an early age onwards,\nbringing into question models in which general cognitive capacities are the\nonly determinants of spatial cognition during the course of development.\n",

        "summary": "  Automatically detecting discourse segments is an important preliminary step\ntowards full discourse parsing. Previous research on discourse segmentation\nhave relied on the assumption that elementary discourse units (EDUs) in a\ndocument always form a linear sequence (i.e., they can never be nested).\nUnfortunately, this assumption turns out to be too strong, for some theories of\ndiscourse like SDRT allows for nested discourse units. In this paper, we\npresent a simple approach to discourse segmentation that is able to produce\nnested EDUs. Our approach builds on standard multi-class classification\ntechniques combined with a simple repairing heuristic that enforces global\ncoherence. Our system was developed and evaluated on the first round of\nannotations provided by the French Annodis project (an ongoing effort to create\na discourse bank for French). Cross-validated on only 47 documents (1,445\nEDUs), our system achieves encouraging performance results with an F-score of\n73% for finding EDUs.\n",

The detection of boundaries between spoken words is an instance\nof a general capability of the human neocortex to remember and to recognize\nrecurring sequences. This paper describes a computer algorithm that is designed\nto solve the problem of locating word boundaries in blocks of English text from\nwhich the spaces have been removed. This problem avoids the complexities of\nspeech processing but requires similar capabilities for detecting recurring\nsequences. The algorithm relies entirely on statistical relationships between\nletters in the input stream to infer the locations of word boundaries. A\nViterbi trellis is used to simultaneously evaluate a set of hypothetical\nsegmentations of a block of adjacent words. This technique improves accuracy\nbut incurs a small latency between the arrival of letters in the input stream\nand the sending of words to the output stream. The source code for a C++\nversion of this algorithm is presented in an appendix.\n",

These sources can be of different kinds,\ne.g., linguistic information, discourse/dialogue structure information, or\ntopic information. For this reason, our algorithm uses various different kinds\nof information (hybrid information). The algorithm is based on linguistic\nconstraints and preferences and uses an anaphoric accessibility space within\nwhich the algorithm finds the noun phrase. We present some experiments related\nto this algorithm and this space using a corpus of 204 dialogues. The algorithm\nis implemented in Prolog.

NLG systems, like most AI systems, need substantial amounts of\nknowledge. However, our experience in two NLG projects suggests that it is\ndifficult to acquire correct knowledge for NLG systems; indeed, every knowledge\nacquisition (KA) technique we tried had significant problems. In general terms,\nthese problems were due to the complexity, novelty, and poorly understood\nnature of the tasks our systems attempted, and were worsened by the fact that\npeople write so differently. This meant in particular that corpus-based KA\napproaches suffered because it was impossible to assemble a sizable corpus of\nhigh-quality consistent manually written texts in our domains; and structured\nexpert-oriented KA techniques suffered because experts disagreed and because we\ncould not get enough information about special and unusual cases to build\nrobust systems. We believe that such problems are likely to affect many other\nNLG systems as well. In the long term, we hope that new KA techniques may\nemerge to help NLG system builders. In the shorter term, we believe that\nunderstanding how individual KA techniques can fail, and using a mixture of\ndifferent KA techniques with different strengths and weaknesses, can help\ndevelopers acquire NLG knowledge that is mostly correct.\n",

Two types of cross-moments are discussed. The sample\nspace for the first one is the set of all derivations of the context-free\ngrammar, and the sample space for the second one is the set of all derivations\nwhich generate a string belonging to the language of the grammar. In the past,\nthis problem was widely studied, but mainly for the cross-moments of scalar\nvariables and up to the second order.

Our inverse lambda operator\nworks on many formal languages including first order logic, database query\nlanguages and answer set programming. Our system uses a syntactic combinatorial\ncategorial parser to parse natural language sentences and also to construct the\nsemantic meaning of the sentences as directed by their parsing. The same parser\nis used for both. In addition to the inverse lambda-calculus operators, our\nsystem uses a notion of generalization to learn semantic representation of\nwords from the semantic representation of other words that are of the same\ncategory.

We test the\ntechnique on the problem of Text Summarization (TS). Extractive TS relies on\nthe concept of sentence salience to identify the most important sentences in a\ndocument or set of documents. Salience is typically defined in terms of the\npresence of particular important words or in terms of similarity to a centroid\npseudo-sentence. We consider a new approach, LexRank, for computing sentence\nimportance based on the concept of eigenvector centrality in a graph\nrepresentation of sentences. In this model, a connectivity matrix based on\nintra-sentence cosine similarity is used as the adjacency matrix of the graph\nrepresentation of sentences. Our system, based on LexRank ranked in first place\nin more than one task in the recent DUC 2004 evaluation. In this paper we\npresent a detailed analysis of our approach and apply it to a larger data set\nincluding data from earlier DUC evaluations. We discuss several methods to\ncompute centrality using the similarity graph. The results show that\ndegree-based methods (including LexRank) outperform both centroid-based methods\nand other systems participating in DUC in most of the cases. Furthermore, the\nLexRank with threshold method outperforms the other degree-based techniques\nincluding continuous LexRank.

        "summary": "  A fundamental requirement of any task-oriented dialogue system is the ability\nto generate object descriptions that refer to objects in the task domain. The\nsubproblem of content selection for object descriptions in task-oriented\ndialogue has been the focus of much previous work and a large number of models\nhave been proposed. In this paper, we use the annotated COCONUT corpus of\ntask-oriented design dialogues to develop feature sets based on Dale and\nReiters (1995) incremental model, Brennan and Clarks (1996) conceptual pact\nmodel, and Jordans (2000b) intentional influences model, and use these feature\nsets in a machine learning experiment to automatically learn a model of content\nselection for object descriptions. Since Dale and Reiters model requires a\nrepresentation of discourse structure, the corpus annotations are used to\nderive a representation based on Grosz and Sidners (1986) theory of the\nintentional structure of discourse, as well as two very simple representations\nof discourse structure based purely on recency. We then apply the\nrule-induction program RIPPER to train and test the content selection component\nof an object description generator on a set of 393 object descriptions from the\ncorpus. To our knowledge, this is the first reported experiment of a trainable\ncontent selection component for object description generation in dialogue.\nThree separate content selection models that are based on the three theoretical\nmodels, all independently achieve accuracies significantly above the majority\nclass baseline (17%) on unseen test data, with the intentional influences model\n(42.4%) performing significantly better than either the incremental model\n(30.4%) or the conceptual pact model (28.9%). But the best performing models\ncombine all the feature sets, achieving accuracies near 60%. Surprisingly, a\nsimple recency-based representation of discourse structure does as well as one\nbased on intentional structure. To our knowledge, this is also the first\nempirical comparison of a representation of Grosz and Sidners model of\ndiscourse structure with a simpler model for any generation task.\n",

PbA performs relatively well with English and outperforms\nseveral other proposed methods. However, the best published word accuracy of\n65.5% (for the 20,000 word NETtalk corpus) suggests there is much room for\nimprovement in it.\n  Previous PbA algorithms have used several different scoring strategies such\nas the product of the frequencies of the component pronunciations of the\nsegments, or the number of different segmentations that yield the same\npronunciation, and different combinations of these methods, to evaluate the\ncandidate pronunciations. In this article, we instead propose to use a\nprobabilistically justified scoring rule. We show that this principled approach\nalone yields better accuracy (66.21% for the NETtalk corpus) than any\npreviously published PbA algorithm. Furthermore, combined with certain ad hoc\nmodifications motivated by earlier algorithms, the performance climbs up to\n66.6%, and further improvements are possible by combining this method with\nother methods.\n",

This\nchallenge arises from the need for the generator to adapt to many features of\nthe dialogue domain, user population, and dialogue context. A promising\napproach is trainable generation, which uses general-purpose linguistic\nknowledge that is automatically adapted to the features of interest, such as\nthe application domain, individual user, or user group. In this paper we\npresent and evaluate a trainable sentence planner for providing restaurant\ninformation in the MATCH dialogue system. We show that trainable sentence\nplanning can produce complex information presentations whose quality is\ncomparable to the output of a template-based generator tuned to this domain. We\nalso show that our method easily supports adapting the sentence planner to\nindividuals, and that the individualized sentence planners generally perform\nbetter than models trained and tested on a population of individuals. Previous\nwork has documented and utilized individual preferences for content selection,\nbut to our knowledge, these results provide the first demonstration of\nindividual preferences for sentence planning operations, affecting the content\norder, discourse structure and sentence structure of system responses.

As a POS tagger, the experimental results show that, the\nproposed algorithm achieves a maximum accuracy of 94.8%.

        "summary": "  In this paper, a supervised learning technique for extracting keyphrases of\nArabic documents is presented. The extractor is supplied with linguistic\nknowledge to enhance its efficiency instead of relying only on statistical\ninformation such as term frequency and distance. During analysis, an annotated\nArabic corpus is used to extract the required lexical features of the document\nwords. The knowledge also includes syntactic rules based on part of speech tags\nand allowed word sequences to extract the candidate keyphrases. In this work,\nthe abstract form of Arabic words is used instead of its stem form to represent\nthe candidate terms. The Abstract form hides most of the inflections found in\nArabic words. The paper introduces new features of keyphrases based on\nlinguistic knowledge, to capture titles and subtitles of a document. A simple\nANOVA test is used to evaluate the validity of selected features. Then, the\nlearning model is built using the LDA - Linear Discriminant Analysis - and\ntraining documents. Although, the presented system is trained using documents\nin the IT domain, experiments carried out show that it has a significantly\nbetter performance than the existing Arabic extractor systems, where precision\nand recall values reach double their corresponding values in the other systems\nespecially for lengthy and non-scientific articles.\n",

Countless\nwriters, orators and students of the English language have used it.\nComputational linguists have employed Roget's for almost 50 years in Natural\nLanguage Processing, however hesitated in accepting Roget's Thesaurus because a\nproper machine tractable version was not available.\n  This dissertation presents an implementation of a machine-tractable version\nof the 1987 Penguin edition of Roget's Thesaurus - the first implementation of\nits kind to use an entire current edition. It explains the steps necessary for\ntaking a machine-readable file and transforming it into a tractable system.\nThis involves converting the lexical material into a format that can be more\neasily exploited, identifying data structures and designing classes to\ncomputerize the Thesaurus.

Essentially, the proposed algorithm can be divided into three\nsub-algorithms that run in a parallel fashion: The error detection algorithm\nthat detects misspellings, the candidates generation algorithm that generates\ncorrection suggestions, and the error correction algorithm that performs\ncontextual error correction.

The paper analyses the stages in the\nevolution of early writing systems which began with the evolution of counting\nin the ancient Near East. A stage anterior to the stage of syllabic\nrepresentation of sounds of a language, is identified. Unique geometric shapes\nrequired for tokens to categorize objects became too large to handle to\nabstract hundreds of categories of goods and metallurgical processes during the\nproduction of bronze-age goods. About 3500 BCE, Indus script as a writing\nsystem was developed to use hieroglyphs to represent the 'spoken words'\nidentifying each of the goods and processes. A rebus method of representing\nsimilar sounding words of the lingua franca of the artisans was used in Indus\nscript. This method is recognized and consistently applied for the lingua\nfranca of the Indian sprachbund. That the ancient languages of India,\nconstituted a sprachbund (or language union) is now recognized by many\nlinguists. The sprachbund area is proximate to the area where most of the Indus\nscript inscriptions were discovered, as documented in the corpora. That\nhundreds of Indian hieroglyphs continued to be used in metallurgy is evidenced\nby their use on early punch-marked coins. This explains the combined use of\nsyllabic scripts such as Brahmi and Kharoshti together with the hieroglyphs on\nRampurva copper bolt, and Sohgaura copper plate from about 6th century\nBCE.Indian hieroglyphs constitute a writing system for meluhha language and are\nrebus representations of archaeo-metallurgy lexemes. The rebus principle was\nemployed by the early scripts and can legitimately be used to decipher the\nIndus script, after secure pictorial identification.\n",

The fact that spell checkers are based on regular\ndictionaries, they suffer from data sparseness problem as they cannot capture\nlarge vocabulary of words including proper names, domain-specific terms,\ntechnical jargons, special acronyms, and terminologies. As a result, they\nexhibit low error detection rate and often fail to catch major errors in the\ntext. This paper proposes a new context-sensitive spelling correction method\nfor detecting and correcting non-word and real-word errors in digital text\ndocuments. The approach hinges around data statistics from Google Web 1T 5-gram\ndata set which consists of a big volume of n-gram word sequences, extracted\nfrom the World Wide Web. Fundamentally, the proposed method comprises an error\ndetector that detects misspellings, a candidate spellings generator based on a\ncharacter 2-gram model that generates correction suggestions, and an error\ncorrector that performs contextual error correction. Experiments conducted on a\nset of text documents from different domains and containing misspellings,\nshowed an outstanding spelling error correction rate and a drastic reduction of\nboth non-word and real-word errors. In a further study, the proposed algorithm\nis to be parallelized so as to lower the computational cost of the error\ndetection and correction processes.\n",

The prototype is domain-specific, the purpose of which is to map\ninstructional text onto a knowledge domain. The context of the knowledge domain\nis DC electrical circuit. During development, the prototype has been tested\nwith a limited data set from the domain. The prototype reached a stage where it\nneeds to be evaluated with a representative linguistic data set called corpus.\nA corpus is a collection of text drawn from typical sources which can be used\nas a test data set to evaluate NLP systems. As there is no available corpus for\nthe domain, we developed and annotated a representative corpus. The evaluation\nof the prototype considers two of its major components- lexical components and\nknowledge model. Evaluation on lexical components enriches the lexical\nresources of the prototype like vocabulary and grammar structures. This leads\nthe prototype to parse a reasonable amount of sentences in the corpus. While\ndealing with the lexicon was straight forward, the identification and\nextraction of appropriate semantic relations was much more involved. It was\nnecessary, therefore, to manually develop a conceptual structure for the domain\nto formulate a domain-specific framework of semantic relations. The framework\nof semantic relationsthat has resulted from this study consisted of 55\nrelations, out of which 42 have inverse relations. We also conducted rhetorical\nanalysis on the corpus to prove its representativeness in conveying semantic.\nFinally, we conducted a topical and discourse analysis on the corpus to analyze\nthe coverage of discourse by the prototype.\n",

Harris provides a\npowerful syntactic way of analysing the detailed meaning of various sentences,\nincluding ambiguous ones. In an adjectival sentence like 'The leather was\nyellow', the introduction of an appropriate noun, here 'colour', specifies\nwhich quality the adjective describes. In some other adjectival sentences with\nan appropriate noun, that noun plays the same part as 'colour' and seems to be\nrelevant to the description of the adjective. These appropriate nouns can\nusually be used in elementary sentences like 'The leather had some colour', but\nin many cases they have a more or less obligatory modifier. For example, you\ncan hardly mention that an object has a colour without qualifying that colour\nat all. About 300 French nouns are appropriate in at least one adjectival\nsentence and have an obligatory modifier. They enter in a number of sentence\nstructures related by several syntactic transformations. The appropriateness of\nthe noun and the fact that the modifier is obligatory are reflected in these\ntransformations. The description of these syntactic phenomena provides a basis\nfor a classification of these nouns. It also concerns the lexical properties of\nthousands of predicative adjectives, and in particular the relations between\nthe sentence without the noun : 'The leather was yellow' and the adjectival\nsentence with the noun : 'The colour of the leather was yellow'.\n",

NFZ-WDA is based on the observation that\nall authors leave distinct intrinsic word usage traces on texts written by them\nand these intrinsic styles can be identified and employed to analyze the\nauthorship. The intrinsic word usage styles can be estimated through the\nanalysis of word distribution within a text, which is more than normal word\nfrequency analysis and can be expressed as: which groups of words are used in\nthe text; how frequently does each group of words occur; how are the\noccurrences of each group of words distributed in the text.

The method is based on compositional translation and\nexploits morpheme-level translation equivalences. It can generate translations\nfor a large variety of morphologically constructed words and can also generate\n'fertile' translations. We show that fertile translations increase the overall\nquality of the extracted lexicon for English to French translation.\n",

However\nthere are, to date, few accessible descriptions of the science of NLP that have\nbeen written for a popular audience, or even for an audience of intelligent,\nbut uninitiated scientists. This paper aims to provide just such an overview.\nIn short, the objective of this article is to describe the purpose, procedures\nand practical applications of NLP in a clear, balanced, and readable way. We\nwill examine the most recent literature describing the methods and processes of\nNLP, analyze some of the challenges that researchers are faced with, and\nbriefly survey some of the current and future applications of this science to\nIT research in general.\n",

        "summary": "  We present a study of the relationship between gender, linguistic style, and\nsocial networks, using a novel corpus of 14,000 Twitter users. Prior\nquantitative work on gender often treats this social variable as a female/male\nbinary; we argue for a more nuanced approach. By clustering Twitter users, we\nfind a natural decomposition of the dataset into various styles and topical\ninterests. Many clusters have strong gender orientations, but their use of\nlinguistic resources sometimes directly conflicts with the population-level\nlanguage statistics. We view these clusters as a more accurate reflection of\nthe multifaceted nature of gendered language styles. Previous corpus-based work\nhas also had little to say about individuals whose linguistic styles defy\npopulation-level gender patterns. To identify such individuals, we train a\nstatistical classifier, and measure the classifier confidence for each\nindividual in the dataset. Examining individuals whose language does not match\nthe classifier's model for their gender, we find that they have social networks\nthat include significantly fewer same-gender social connections and that, in\ngeneral, social network homophily is correlated with the use of same-gender\nlanguage markers. Pairing computational methods and social theory thus offers a\nnew perspective on how gender emerges as individuals position themselves\nrelative to audiences, topics, and mainstream gender norms.\n",

Using the Hangulphabet, a user can instantly\nsee voicing, manner and place of articulation of any phoneme found in human\nlanguage. The Hangulphabet places consonant graphemes on a grid with the x-axis\nrepresenting the place of articulation and the y-axis representing manner of\narticulation. Each individual grapheme contains radicals from both axes where\nthe points intersect. The top radical represents manner of articulation where\nthe bottom represents place of articulation. A horizontal line running through\nthe middle of the bottom radical represents voicing. For vowels, place of\narticulation is located on a grid that represents the position of the tongue in\nthe mouth. This grid is similar to that of the IPA vowel chart (International\nPhonetic Association, 1999). The difference with the Hangulphabet being the\ntrapezoid representing the vocal apparatus is on a slight tilt. Place of\narticulation for a vowel is represented by a breakout figure from the grid.\nThis system can be used as an alternative to the International Phonetic\nAlphabet (IPA) or as a complement to it. Beginning students of linguistics may\nfind it particularly useful. A Hangulphabet font has been created to facilitate\nswitching between the Hangulphabet and the IPA.\n",

        "summary": "  The paper revives an older approach to acoustic modeling that borrows from\nn-gram language modeling in an attempt to scale up both the amount of training\ndata and model size (as measured by the number of parameters in the model), to\napproximately 100 times larger than current sizes used in automatic speech\nrecognition. In such a data-rich setting, we can expand the phonetic context\nsignificantly beyond triphones, as well as increase the number of Gaussian\nmixture components for the context-dependent states that allow it. We have\nexperimented with contexts that span seven or more context-independent phones,\nand up to 620 mixture components per state. Dealing with unseen phonetic\ncontexts is accomplished using the familiar back-off technique used in language\nmodeling due to implementation simplicity. The back-off acoustic model is\nestimated, stored and served using MapReduce distributed computing\ninfrastructure.\n  Speech recognition experiments are carried out in an N-best list rescoring\nframework for Google Voice Search. Training big models on large amounts of data\nproves to be an effective way to increase the accuracy of a state-of-the-art\nautomatic speech recognition system. We use 87,000 hours of training data\n(speech along with transcription) obtained by filtering utterances in Voice\nSearch logs on automatic speech recognition confidence. Models ranging in size\nbetween 20--40 million Gaussians are estimated using maximum likelihood\ntraining. They achieve relative reductions in word-error-rate of 11% and 6%\nwhen combined with first-pass models trained using maximum likelihood, and\nboosted maximum mutual information, respectively. Increasing the context size\nbeyond five phones (quinphones) does not help.\n",

Besides, these resources are just limited to a few\nlanguages, such as English, French, and Spanish and so on. So, obtaining\ncomparable corpora automatically for such domains could be an answer to this\nproblem effectively. Comparable corpora, that the subcorpora are not\ntranslations of each other, can be easily obtained from web. Therefore,\nbuilding and using comparable corpora is often a more feasible option in\nmultilingual information processing. Comparability metrics is one of key issues\nin the field of building and using comparable corpus. Currently, there is no\nwidely accepted definition or metrics method of corpus comparability. In fact,\nDifferent definitions or metrics methods of comparability might be given to\nsuit various tasks about natural language processing. A new comparability,\nnamely, termhood-based metrics, oriented to the task of bilingual terminology\nextraction, is proposed in this paper. In this method, words are ranked by\ntermhood not frequency, and then the cosine similarities, calculated based on\nthe ranking lists of word termhood, is used as comparability. Experiments\nresults show that termhood-based metrics performs better than traditional\nfrequency-based metrics.\n",

The new method computes the termhood of the terminology candidate as\nwell as the sentence that includes the terminology by the comparison of the\ncorpus. Since terminologies and general words usually have differently\ndistribution in the corpus, termhood can also be used to constrain and enhance\nthe performance of term alignment when aligning bilingual terms on the parallel\ncorpus. In this paper, bilingual term alignment based on termhood constraints\nis presented.\n  Findings: Experiment results show multi-level termhood can get better\nperformance than existing method for terminology extraction. If termhood is\nused as constrain factor, the performance of bilingual term alignment can be\nimproved.\n",

As grew larger, performance was expected to\nimprove, in the limit performing the same as word-based taggers.

The explosion of\nWeb 2.0 has led to increased activity in Podcasting, Blogging, Tagging,\nContributing to RSS, Social Bookmarking, and Social Networking. As a result\nthere has been an eruption of interest in people to mine these vast resources\nof data for opinions. Sentiment Analysis or Opinion Mining is the computational\ntreatment of opinions, sentiments and subjectivity of text. In this report, we\ntake a look at the various challenges and applications of Sentiment Analysis.\nWe will discuss in details various approaches to perform a computational\ntreatment of sentiments and opinions. Various supervised or data-driven\ntechniques to SA like Na\\\"ive Byes, Maximum Entropy, SVM, and Voted Perceptrons\nwill be discussed and their strengths and drawbacks will be touched upon. We\nwill also see a new dimension of analyzing sentiments by Cognitive Psychology\nmainly through the work of Janyce Wiebe, where we will see ways to detect\nsubjectivity, perspective in narrative and understanding the discourse\nstructure. We will also study some specific topics in Sentiment Analysis and\nthe contemporary works in those areas.\n",

        "summary": "  Conceptual combination performs a fundamental role in creating the broad\nrange of compound phrases utilized in everyday language. This article provides\na novel probabilistic framework for assessing whether the semantics of\nconceptual combinations are compositional, and so can be considered as a\nfunction of the semantics of the constituent concepts, or not. While the\nsystematicity and productivity of language provide a strong argument in favor\nof assuming compositionality, this very assumption is still regularly\nquestioned in both cognitive science and philosophy. Additionally, the\nprinciple of semantic compositionality is underspecified, which means that\nnotions of both \"strong\" and \"weak\" compositionality appear in the literature.\nRather than adjudicating between different grades of compositionality, the\nframework presented here contributes formal methods for determining a clear\ndividing line between compositional and non-compositional semantics. In\naddition, we suggest that the distinction between these is contextually\nsensitive. Utilizing formal frameworks developed for analyzing composite\nsystems in quantum theory, we present two methods that allow the semantics of\nconceptual combinations to be classified as \"compositional\" or\n\"non-compositional\". Compositionality is first formalised by factorising the\njoint probability distribution modeling the combination, where the terms in the\nfactorisation correspond to individual concepts. This leads to the necessary\nand sufficient condition for the joint probability distribution to exist. A\nfailure to meet this condition implies that the underlying concepts cannot be\nmodeled in a single probability space when considering their combination, and\nthe combination is thus deemed \"non-compositional\". The formal analysis methods\nare demonstrated by applying them to an empirical study of twenty-four\nnon-lexicalised conceptual combinations.\n",

We propose an\neffective and efficient framework for S&T that introduces features to\nsignificantly reduce meaningless words generation. A general lexicon, Wikepedia\nand a large-scale raw corpus of 200 billion characters are used to generate\nword-based features for the wordhood. The word-lattice based framework consists\nof a character-based model and a word-based model in order to employ our\nword-based features.

In\nthis paper we show how the combined strength and wisdom of the crowds can be\nused to generate a large, high-quality, word-emotion and word-polarity\nassociation lexicon quickly and inexpensively. We enumerate the challenges in\nemotion annotation in a crowdsourcing scenario and propose solutions to address\nthem. Most notably, in addition to questions about emotions associated with\nterms, we show how the inclusion of a word choice question can discourage\nmalicious data entry, help identify instances where the annotator may not be\nfamiliar with the target term (allowing us to reject such annotations), and\nhelp obtain annotations at sense level (rather than at word level). We\nconducted experiments on how to formulate the emotion-annotation questions, and\nshow that asking if a term is associated with an emotion leads to markedly\nhigher inter-annotator agreement than that obtained by asking if a term evokes\nan emotion.\n",

        "summary": "  Knowing the degree of semantic contrast between words has widespread\napplication in natural language processing, including machine translation,\ninformation retrieval, and dialogue systems. Manually-created lexicons focus on\nopposites, such as {\\rm hot} and {\\rm cold}. Opposites are of many kinds such\nas antipodals, complementaries, and gradable. However, existing lexicons often\ndo not classify opposites into the different kinds. They also do not explicitly\nlist word pairs that are not opposites but yet have some degree of contrast in\nmeaning, such as {\\rm warm} and {\\rm cold} or {\\rm tropical} and {\\rm\nfreezing}. We propose an automatic method to identify contrasting word pairs\nthat is based on the hypothesis that if a pair of words, $A$ and $B$, are\ncontrasting, then there is a pair of opposites, $C$ and $D$, such that $A$ and\n$C$ are strongly related and $B$ and $D$ are strongly related. (For example,\nthere exists the pair of opposites {\\rm hot} and {\\rm cold} such that {\\rm\ntropical} is related to {\\rm hot,} and {\\rm freezing} is related to {\\rm\ncold}.) We will call this the contrast hypothesis. We begin with a large\ncrowdsourcing experiment to determine the amount of human agreement on the\nconcept of oppositeness and its different kinds. In the process, we flesh out\nkey features of different kinds of opposites. We then present an automatic and\nempirical measure of lexical contrast that relies on the contrast hypothesis,\ncorpus statistics, and the structure of a {\\it Roget}-like thesaurus. We show\nthat the proposed measure of lexical contrast obtains high precision and large\ncoverage, outperforming existing methods.\n",

For many languages word segmentation is a\nnon-trivial task and naturally occurring text is sometimes a mixture of natural\nlanguage strings and other character data. We propose to learn text\nrepresentations directly from raw character sequences by training a Simple\nrecurrent Network to predict the next character in text. The network uses its\nhidden layer to evolve abstract representations of the character sequences it\nsees. To demonstrate the usefulness of the learned text embeddings, we use them\nas features in a supervised character level text segmentation and labeling\ntask: recognizing spans of text containing programming language code.

We identified\nthree subtasks that need to be addressed: definition of the target; separation\nof the good and bad news content from the good and bad sentiment expressed on\nthe target; and analysis of clearly marked opinion that is expressed\nexplicitly, not needing interpretation or the use of world knowledge.\nFurthermore, we distinguish three different possible views on newspaper\narticles - author, reader and text, which have to be addressed differently at\nthe time of analysing sentiment. Given these definitions, we present work on\nmining opinions about entities in English language news, in which (a) we test\nthe relative suitability of various sentiment dictionaries and (b) we attempt\nto separate positive or negative opinion from good or bad news. In the\nexperiments described here, we tested whether or not subject domain-defining\nvocabulary should be ignored. Results showed that this idea is more appropriate\nin the context of news opinion mining and that the approaches taking this into\nconsideration produce a better performance.\n",

Most\nprevious work utilizes manual patterns for this task. However, the performance\nof those methods highly relies on the labelled patterns or selected seeds. In\norder to overcome the above problem, this paper presents an automatic framework\nto detect large-scale domain-specific patterns for DSSW extraction. To this\nend, sentiment seeds are extracted from massive dataset of user comments.\nSubsequently, these sentiment seeds are expanded by synonyms using a\nbootstrapping mechanism. Simultaneously, a synonymy graph is built and the\ngraph propagation algorithm is applied on the built synonymy graph. Afterwards,\nsyntactic and sequential relations between target words and high-ranked\nsentiment words are extracted automatically to construct large-scale patterns,\nwhich are further used to extracte DSSWs. The experimental results in three\ndomains reveal the effectiveness of our method.\n",

Semantic\nmeasures play an important role to compare such elements according to semantic\nproxies: texts and knowledge representations, which support their meaning or\ndescribe their nature. Semantic measures are therefore essential for designing\nintelligent agents which will for example take advantage of semantic analysis\nto mimic human ability to compare abstract or concrete objects. This paper\nproposes a comprehensive survey of the broad notion of semantic measure for the\ncomparison of units of language, concepts or instances based on semantic proxy\nanalyses.

        "summary": "  Objective: Narrative text in Electronic health records (EHR) contain rich\ninformation for medical and data science studies. This paper introduces the\ndesign and performance of Narrative Information Linear Extraction (NILE), a\nnatural language processing (NLP) package for EHR analysis that we share with\nthe medical informatics community. Methods: NILE uses a modified prefix-tree\nsearch algorithm for named entity recognition, which can detect prefix and\nsuffix sharing. The semantic analyses are implemented as rule-based finite\nstate machines. Analyses include negation, location, modification, family\nhistory, and ignoring. Result: The processing speed of NILE is hundreds to\nthousands times faster than existing NLP software for medical text. The\naccuracy of presence analysis of NILE is on par with the best performing models\non the 2010 i2b2/VA NLP challenge data. Conclusion: The speed, accuracy, and\nbeing able to operate via API make NILE a valuable addition to the NLP software\nfor medical informatics and data science.\n",

        "summary": "  In modern electronic medical records (EMR) much of the clinically important\ndata - signs and symptoms, symptom severity, disease status, etc. - are not\nprovided in structured data fields, but rather are encoded in clinician\ngenerated narrative text. Natural language processing (NLP) provides a means of\n\"unlocking\" this important data source for applications in clinical decision\nsupport, quality assurance, and public health. This chapter provides an\noverview of representative NLP systems in biomedicine based on a unified\narchitectural view. A general architecture in an NLP system consists of two\nmain components: background knowledge that includes biomedical knowledge\nresources and a framework that integrates NLP tools to process text. Systems\ndiffer in both components, which we will review briefly. Additionally,\nchallenges facing current research efforts in biomedical NLP include the\npaucity of large, publicly available annotated corpora, although initiatives\nthat facilitate data sharing, system evaluation, and collaborative work between\nresearchers in clinical NLP are starting to emerge.\n",

First, we\napplied Rouge measure to compare the new techniques among systems presented at\nTAC2011.

To date, a wide variety of approaches to\ngeo-semantic similarity have been devised. A judgment of similarity is not\nintrinsically right or wrong, but obtains a certain degree of cognitive\nplausibility, depending on how closely it mimics human behavior. Thus selecting\nthe most appropriate measure for a specific task is a significant challenge. To\naddress this issue, we make an analogy between computational similarity\nmeasures and soliciting domain expert opinions, which incorporate a subjective\nset of beliefs, perceptions, hypotheses, and epistemic biases. Following this\nanalogy, we define the semantic similarity ensemble (SSE) as a composition of\ndifferent similarity measures, acting as a panel of experts having to reach a\ndecision on the semantic similarity of a set of geographic terms. The approach\nis evaluated in comparison to human judgments, and results indicate that an SSE\nperforms better than the average of its parts. Although the best member tends\nto outperform the ensemble, all ensembles outperform the average performance of\neach ensemble's member. Hence, in contexts where the best measure is unknown,\nthe ensemble provides a more cognitively plausible approach.\n",

Self-training tools obviously alleviate the problem, but even the\neffort of providing training data and of manually tuning the results is usually\nconsiderable. In this paper, we gather insights by various multilingual system\ndevelopers on how to minimise the effort of developing natural language\nprocessing applications for many languages. We also explain the main guidelines\nunderlying our own effort to develop complex text mining software for tens of\nlanguages. While these guidelines - most of all: extreme simplicity - can be\nvery restrictive and limiting, we believe to have shown the feasibility of the\napproach through the development of the Europe Media Monitor (EMM) family of\napplications (http://emm.newsbrief.eu/overview.html). EMM is a set of complex\nmedia monitoring tools that process and analyse up to 100,000 online news\narticles per day in between twenty and fifty languages. We will also touch upon\nthe kind of language resources that would make it easier for all to develop\nhighly multilingual text mining applications.

        "summary": "  Large bilingual parallel texts (also known as bitexts) are usually stored in\na compressed form, and previous work has shown that they can be more\nefficiently compressed if the fact that the two texts are mutual translations\nis exploited. For example, a bitext can be seen as a sequence of biwords\n---pairs of parallel words with a high probability of co-occurrence--- that can\nbe used as an intermediate representation in the compression process. However,\nthe simple biword approach described in the literature can only exploit\none-to-one word alignments and cannot tackle the reordering of words. We\ntherefore introduce a generalization of biwords which can describe multi-word\nexpressions and reorderings. We also describe some methods for the binary\ncompression of generalized biword sequences, and compare their performance when\ndifferent schemes are applied to the extraction of the biword sequence. In\naddition, we show that this generalization of biwords allows for the\nimplementation of an efficient algorithm to look on the compressed bitext for\nwords or text segments in one of the texts and retrieve their counterpart\ntranslations in the other text ---an application usually referred to as\ntranslation spotting--- with only some minor modifications in the compression\nalgorithm.\n",

Without doubt, a measure of relatedness between text segments must take\ninto account both the lexical and the semantic relatedness between words. Such\na measure that captures well both aspects of text relatedness may help in many\ntasks, such as text retrieval, classification and clustering. In this paper we\npresent a new approach for measuring the semantic relatedness between words\nbased on their implicit semantic links. The approach exploits only a word\nthesaurus in order to devise implicit semantic links between words. Based on\nthis approach, we introduce Omiotis, a new measure of semantic relatedness\nbetween texts which capitalizes on the word-to-word semantic relatedness\nmeasure (SR) and extends it to measure the relatedness between texts. We\ngradually validate our method: we first evaluate the performance of the\nsemantic relatedness measure between individual words, covering word-to-word\nsimilarity and relatedness, synonym identification and word analogy; then, we\nproceed with evaluating the performance of our method in measuring text-to-text\nsemantic relatedness in two tasks, namely sentence-to-sentence similarity and\nparaphrase recognition.

MWEs pose a huge\nproblem to the precise language processing due to their idiosyncratic nature\nand diversity in lexical, syntactical and semantic properties. The semantics of\na MWE cannot be expressed after combining the semantics of its constituents.\nTherefore, the formalism of semantic clustering is often viewed as an\ninstrument for extracting MWEs especially for resource constraint languages\nlike Bengali. The present semantic clustering approach contributes to locate\nclusters of the synonymous noun tokens present in the document. These clusters\nin turn help measure the similarity between the constituent words of a\npotentially candidate phrase using a vector space model and judge the\nsuitability of this phrase to be a MWE. In this experiment, we apply the\nsemantic clustering approach for noun-noun bigram MWEs, though it can be\nextended to any types of MWEs.

        "summary": "  We present a statistical parsing framework for sentence-level sentiment\nclassification in this article. Unlike previous works that employ syntactic\nparsing results for sentiment analysis, we develop a statistical parser to\ndirectly analyze the sentiment structure of a sentence. We show that\ncomplicated phenomena in sentiment analysis (e.g., negation, intensification,\nand contrast) can be handled the same as simple and straightforward sentiment\nexpressions in a unified and probabilistic way. We formulate the sentiment\ngrammar upon Context-Free Grammars (CFGs), and provide a formal description of\nthe sentiment parsing framework. We develop the parsing model to obtain\npossible sentiment parse trees for a sentence, from which the polarity model is\nproposed to derive the sentiment strength and polarity, and the ranking model\nis dedicated to selecting the best sentiment tree. We train the parser directly\nfrom examples of sentences annotated only with sentiment polarity labels but\nwithout any syntactic annotations or polarity annotations of constituents\nwithin sentences. Therefore we can obtain training data easily. In particular,\nwe train a sentiment parser, s.parser, from a large amount of review sentences\nwith users' ratings as rough sentiment polarity labels. Extensive experiments\non existing benchmark datasets show significant improvements over baseline\nsentiment classification approaches.\n",

We evaluate the performance\nof the model on aspect identification, sentiment analysis, and per-word\nlabeling accuracy.

Although these\napproaches have shown promise, several issues related to human language\nbehavior and human-machine conversation have not been addressed. First,\npsycholinguistic studies have shown certain temporal regularities between human\neye movement and language production. While these regularities can potentially\nguide the acquisition process, they have not been incorporated in the previous\nunsupervised approaches. Second, conversational systems generally have an\nexisting knowledge base about the domain and vocabulary. While the existing\nknowledge can potentially help bootstrap and constrain the acquired new words,\nit has not been incorporated in the previous models. Third, eye gaze could\nserve different functions in human-machine conversation. Some gaze streams may\nnot be closely coupled with speech stream, and thus are potentially detrimental\nto word acquisition. Automated recognition of closely-coupled speech-gaze\nstreams based on conversation context is important. To address these issues, we\ndeveloped new approaches that incorporate user language behavior, domain\nknowledge, and conversation context in word acquisition. We evaluated these\napproaches in the context of situated dialogue in a virtual world.

The evaluation for Indonesian- >English\nusing Malay and for Spanish -> English using Portuguese and pretending Spanish\nis resource-poor shows an absolute gain of up to 1.35 and 3.37 BLEU points,\nrespectively, which is an improvement over the best rivaling approaches, while\nusing much less additional data.

The\nmorphophonemic changes like addition, deletion, alternation etc., occur when\ntwo or more morphemes or words joined together.

It is also useful for tagging, ontology\nconstruction [Ryu and Choi 2006], and automatic summarization of documents\n[Louis and Nenkova 2011, Chali and Hassan 2012]. Term frequency and\ninverse-document frequency (TF-IDF) are typically used to do this, but fail to\ntake advantage of the semantic relationships between terms [Church and Gale\n1995]. The result is that general idiomatic terms are mistaken for specific\nterms. We demonstrate use of relational data for estimation of term\nspecificity. The specificity of a term can be learned from its distribution of\nrelations with other terms. This technique is useful for identifying relevant\nwords or terms for other natural language processing tasks.\n",

The implemented stemmer\nincludes hash tables and several deterministic finite automata in its different\nlevels of hierarchy for removing the prefixes and suffixes of the words. We had\ntwo intentions in using hash tables in our method. The first one is that the\nDFA don't support some special words, so hash table can partly solve the\naddressed problem. the second goal is to speed up the implemented stemmer with\nomitting the time that deterministic finite automata need. Because of the\nhierarchical organization, this method is fast and flexible enough. Our\nexperiments on test sets from Hamshahri collection and security news (istna.ir)\nshow that our method has the average accuracy of 95.37% which is even improved\nin using the method on a test set with common topics.\n",

        "summary": "  We present a novel technique for learning semantic representations, which\nextends the distributional hypothesis to multilingual data and joint-space\nembeddings. Our models leverage parallel data and learn to strongly align the\nembeddings of semantically equivalent sentences, while maintaining sufficient\ndistance between those of dissimilar sentences. The models do not rely on word\nalignments or any syntactic information and are successfully applied to a\nnumber of diverse languages. We extend our approach to learn semantic\nrepresentations at the document level, too. We evaluate these models on two\ncross-lingual document classification tasks, outperforming the prior state of\nthe art. Through qualitative analysis and the study of pivoting effects we\ndemonstrate that our representations are semantically plausible and can capture\nsemantic relationships across languages without parallel data.\n",

Radical is a semantic and phonetic component of Chinese character.\nIt plays an important role as characters with the same radical usually have\nsimilar semantic meaning and grammatical usage.

Here, we\ninvestigated the use of the AMT in capturing disease mentions in PubMed\nabstracts.

We show that, via this focus on similarity, SimLex-999\nincentivizes the development of models with a different, and arguably wider\nrange of applications than those which reflect conceptual association. Second,\nSimLex-999 contains a range of concrete and abstract adjective, noun and verb\npairs, together with an independent rating of concreteness and (free)\nassociation strength for each pair. This diversity enables fine-grained\nanalyses of the performance of models on concepts of different types, and\nconsequently greater insight into how architectures can be improved.

Recently, several actual suicidal cases were preceded by users who\nposted microblogs with suicidal ideation to Sina Weibo, a Chinese social media\nnetwork akin to Twitter.

A lot of research has been devoted to finding ways\nof representing the semantics of individual words in vector spaces.\nDistributional approaches --- meaning distributed representations that exploit\nco-occurrence statistics of large corpora --- have proved popular and\nsuccessful across a number of tasks. However, natural language usually comes in\nstructures beyond the word level, with meaning arising not only from the\nindividual words but also the structure they are contained in at the phrasal or\nsentential level. Modelling the compositional process by which the meaning of\nan utterance arises from the meaning of its parts is an equally fundamental\ntask of NLP.\n  This dissertation explores methods for learning distributed semantic\nrepresentations and models for composing these into representations for larger\nlinguistic units. Our underlying hypothesis is that neural models are a\nsuitable vehicle for learning semantically rich representations and that such\nrepresentations in turn are suitable vehicles for solving important tasks in\nnatural language processing. The contribution of this thesis is a thorough\nevaluation of our hypothesis, as part of which we introduce several new\napproaches to representation learning and compositional semantics, as well as\nmultiple state-of-the-art models which apply distributed semantic\nrepresentations to various tasks in NLP.\n",

Third, to fully exploit the power of\ntype-driven semantic parsing beyond simple types (such as entities and truth\nvalues), we borrow from programming language theory the concepts of subtype\npolymorphism and parametric polymorphism to enrich the type system in order to\nbetter guide the parsing.

We first focused on the semantics to see how Astell\nbuilds her vindication of the female sex, which words she uses to sensitise\nwomen to their alienated condition and promote their education. Then we studied\nthe morphology of the lexemes (which is different from contemporary English)\nused by the author, thanks to the NooJ tools we have devised for this purpose.\nNooJ has great functionalities for lexicographic work. Its commands and graphs\nprove to be most efficient in the spotting of archaic words or variants in\nspelling. Introduction In our previous articles, we have studied the\nsingularities of 17 th century English within the framework of a diachronic\nanalysis thanks to syntactical and morphological graphs and thanks to the\ndictionaries we have compiled from a corpus that may be expanded overtime. Our\nearly work was based on a limited corpus of English travel literature to Greece\nin the 17 th century. This article deals with a late seventeenth century text\nwritten by a woman philosopher and essayist, Mary Astell (1666--1731),\nconsidered as one of the first English feminists. Astell wrote her essay at a\ntime in English history when women were \"the weaker vessel\" and their main\nbusiness in life was to charm and please men by their looks and submissiveness.\nIn this essay we will see how NooJ can help us analyse Astell's rhetoric (what\npoint of view does she adopt, does she speak in her own name, in the name of\nall women, what is her representation of men and women and their relationships\nin the text, what are the goals of education?). Then we will turn our attention\nto the morphology of words in the text and use NooJ commands and graphs to\ncarry out a lexicographic inquiry into Astell's lexemes.\n",

UG specifies the\nrestricted set of languages learnable by human brain, and thus, many\nresearchers believe in its biological roots. Numerous empirical studies of\nneurobiological and cognitive functions of the human brain, and of many natural\nlanguages, have been conducted to unveil some aspects of UG. This, however,\nresulted in different and sometimes contradicting theories that do not indicate\na universally unique grammar. In this research, we tackle the UG problem from\nan entirely different perspective. We search for the Unique Universal Grammar\n(UUG) that facilitates communication and knowledge transfer, the sole purpose\nof a language. We formulate this UG and show that it is unique, intrinsic, and\ncosmic, rather than humanistic. Initial analysis on a widespread natural\nlanguage already showed some positive results.\n",

The\ncase-inflectional forms of a noun normally number 24 owing to the fact that in\nSanskrit there are eight cases and three numbers-singular, dual and plural. The\ntraditional method of generating these inflectional forms is rather elaborate\nowing to the fact that there are differences in the forms generated between\neven very similar words and there are subtle nuances involved. Further, it\nwould be a cumbersome exercise to generate and search for 24 forms of a word\nduring a word search in a large text, using the currently available\ncase-inflectional form generators. This study presents a new approach to\ngenerating case-inflectional forms that is simpler to compute.

This\ngenerally involves a huge number of features. Some techniques, such as Latent\nSemantic Analysis (LSA) or Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), have been\ndesigned to summarize documents in a lower dimension with the least semantic\ninformation loss. Some semantic information is nevertheless always lost, since\nonly words are considered. Instead, we aim at using information coming from\nn-grams to overcome this limitation, while remaining in a low-dimension space.\nMany approaches, such as the Skip-gram model, provide good word vector\nrepresentations very quickly. We propose to average these representations to\nobtain representations of n-grams. All n-grams are thus embedded in a same\nsemantic space. A K-means clustering can then group them into semantic\nconcepts. The number of features is therefore dramatically reduced and\ndocuments can be represented as bag of semantic concepts.

        "summary": "  Word reordering is one of the most difficult aspects of statistical machine\ntranslation (SMT), and an important factor of its quality and efficiency.\nDespite the vast amount of research published to date, the interest of the\ncommunity in this problem has not decreased, and no single method appears to be\nstrongly dominant across language pairs. Instead, the choice of the optimal\napproach for a new translation task still seems to be mostly driven by\nempirical trials. To orientate the reader in this vast and complex research\narea, we present a comprehensive survey of word reordering viewed as a\nstatistical modeling challenge and as a natural language phenomenon. The survey\ndescribes in detail how word reordering is modeled within different\nstring-based and tree-based SMT frameworks and as a stand-alone task, including\nsystematic overviews of the literature in advanced reordering modeling. We then\nquestion why some approaches are more successful than others in different\nlanguage pairs. We argue that, besides measuring the amount of reordering, it\nis important to understand which kinds of reordering occur in a given language\npair. To this end, we conduct a qualitative analysis of word reordering\nphenomena in a diverse sample of language pairs, based on a large collection of\nlinguistic knowledge. Empirical results in the SMT literature are shown to\nsupport the hypothesis that a few linguistic facts can be very useful to\nanticipate the reordering characteristics of a language pair and to select the\nSMT framework that best suits them.\n",

        "summary": "  Discourse markers are universal linguistic events subject to language\nvariation. Although an extensive literature has already reported language\nspecific traits of these events, little has been said on their cross-language\nbehavior and on building an inventory of multilingual lexica of discourse\nmarkers. This work describes new methods and approaches for the description,\nclassification, and annotation of discourse markers in the specific domain of\nthe Europarl corpus. The study of discourse markers in the context of\ntranslation is crucial due to the idiomatic nature of these structures.\nMultilingual lexica together with the functional analysis of such structures\nare useful tools for the hard task of translating discourse markers into\npossible equivalents from one language to another. Using Daniel Marcu's\nvalidated discourse markers for English, extracted from the Brown Corpus, our\npurpose is to build multilingual lexica of discourse markers for other\nlanguages, based on machine translation techniques. The major assumption in\nthis study is that the usage of a discourse marker is independent of the\nlanguage, i.e., the rhetorical function of a discourse marker in a sentence in\none language is equivalent to the rhetorical function of the same discourse\nmarker in another language.\n",

First, it requires neither hand written rules\nnor a training corpus of aligned standard and simplified sentences. Second,\nsentence splitting operates on deep semantic structure. We show (i) that the\nunsupervised framework we propose is competitive with four state-of-the-art\nsupervised systems and (ii) that our semantic based approach allows for a\nprincipled and effective handling of sentence splitting.\n",

        "summary": "  Recently, the focus of complex networks research has shifted from the\nanalysis of isolated properties of a system toward a more realistic modeling of\nmultiple phenomena - multilayer networks. Motivated by the prosperity of\nmultilayer approach in social, transport or trade systems, we propose the\nintroduction of multilayer networks for language. The multilayer network of\nlanguage is a unified framework for modeling linguistic subsystems and their\nstructural properties enabling the exploration of their mutual interactions.\nVarious aspects of natural language systems can be represented as complex\nnetworks, whose vertices depict linguistic units, while links model their\nrelations. The multilayer network of language is defined by three aspects: the\nnetwork construction principle, the linguistic subsystem and the language of\ninterest. More precisely, we construct a word-level (syntax, co-occurrence and\nits shuffled counterpart) and a subword level (syllables and graphemes) network\nlayers, from five variations of original text (in the modeled language). The\nobtained results suggest that there are substantial differences between the\nnetworks structures of different language subsystems, which are hidden during\nthe exploration of an isolated layer. The word-level layers share structural\nproperties regardless of the language (e.g. Croatian or English), while the\nsyllabic subword level expresses more language dependent structural properties.\nThe preserved weighted overlap quantifies the similarity of word-level layers\nin weighted and directed networks. Moreover, the analysis of motifs reveals a\nclose topological structure of the syntactic and syllabic layers for both\nlanguages. The findings corroborate that the multilayer network framework is a\npowerful, consistent and systematic approach to model several linguistic\nsubsystems simultaneously and hence to provide a more unified view on language.\n",

        "summary": "  A common evaluation practice in the vector space models (VSMs) literature is\nto measure the models' ability to predict human judgments about lexical\nsemantic relations between word pairs. Most existing evaluation sets, however,\nconsist of scores collected for English word pairs only, ignoring the potential\nimpact of the judgment language in which word pairs are presented on the human\nscores. In this paper we translate two prominent evaluation sets, wordsim353\n(association) and SimLex999 (similarity), from English to Italian, German and\nRussian and collect scores for each dataset from crowdworkers fluent in its\nlanguage. Our analysis reveals that human judgments are strongly impacted by\nthe judgment language. Moreover, we show that the predictions of monolingual\nVSMs do not necessarily best correlate with human judgments made with the\nlanguage used for model training, suggesting that models and humans are\naffected differently by the language they use when making semantic judgments.\nFinally, we show that in a large number of setups, multilingual VSM combination\nresults in improved correlations with human judgments, suggesting that\nmultilingualism may partially compensate for the judgment language effect on\nhuman judgments.\n",

The central challenge arises from two compounding factors: the\nbroader domain results in an open-ended set of relations, and the deeper\ncompositionality results in a combinatorial explosion in the space of logical\nforms.

        "summary": "  This thesis investigates how the sub-structure of words can be accounted for\nin probabilistic models of language. Such models play an important role in\nnatural language processing tasks such as translation or speech recognition,\nbut often rely on the simplistic assumption that words are opaque symbols. This\nassumption does not fit morphologically complex language well, where words can\nhave rich internal structure and sub-word elements are shared across distinct\nword forms.\n  Our approach is to encode basic notions of morphology into the assumptions of\nthree different types of language models, with the intention that leveraging\nshared sub-word structure can improve model performance and help overcome data\nsparsity that arises from morphological processes.\n  In the context of n-gram language modelling, we formulate a new Bayesian\nmodel that relies on the decomposition of compound words to attain better\nsmoothing, and we develop a new distributed language model that learns vector\nrepresentations of morphemes and leverages them to link together\nmorphologically related words. In both cases, we show that accounting for word\nsub-structure improves the models' intrinsic performance and provides benefits\nwhen applied to other tasks, including machine translation.\n  We then shift the focus beyond the modelling of word sequences and consider\nmodels that automatically learn what the sub-word elements of a given language\nare, given an unannotated list of words. We formulate a novel model that can\nlearn discontiguous morphemes in addition to the more conventional contiguous\nmorphemes that most previous models are limited to. This approach is\ndemonstrated on Semitic languages, and we find that modelling discontiguous\nsub-word structures leads to improvements in the task of segmenting words into\ntheir contiguous morphemes.\n",

In this paper, we\npropose an approach for unsupervised discovery of linguistic structure for the\ntarget spoken language given raw speech data. This linguistic structure\nincludes two-level (subword-like and word-like) acoustic patterns, the lexicon\nof word-like patterns in terms of subword-like patterns and the N-gram language\nmodel based on word-like patterns. All patterns, models, and parameters can be\nautomatically learned from the unlabelled speech corpus. This is achieved by an\ninitialization step followed by three cascaded stages for acoustic, linguistic,\nand lexical iterative optimization. The lexicon of word-like patterns defines\nallowed consecutive sequence of HMMs for subword-like patterns. In each\niteration, model training and decoding produces updated labels from which the\nlexicon and HMMs can be further updated. In this way, model parameters and\ndecoded labels are respectively optimized in each iteration, and the knowledge\nabout the linguistic structure is learned gradually layer after layer.

        "summary": "  Speech recognition systems are often highly domain dependent, a fact widely\nreported in the literature. However the concept of domain is complex and not\nbound to clear criteria. Hence it is often not evident if data should be\nconsidered to be out-of-domain. While both acoustic and language models can be\ndomain specific, work in this paper concentrates on acoustic modelling. We\npresent a novel method to perform unsupervised discovery of domains using\nLatent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) modelling. Here a set of hidden domains is\nassumed to exist in the data, whereby each audio segment can be considered to\nbe a weighted mixture of domain properties. The classification of audio\nsegments into domains allows the creation of domain specific acoustic models\nfor automatic speech recognition. Experiments are conducted on a dataset of\ndiverse speech data covering speech from radio and TV broadcasts, telephone\nconversations, meetings, lectures and read speech, with a joint training set of\n60 hours and a test set of 6 hours. Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) adaptation to\nLDA based domains was shown to yield relative Word Error Rate (WER)\nimprovements of up to 16% relative, compared to pooled training, and up to 10%,\ncompared with models adapted with human-labelled prior domain knowledge.\n",

There are scenarios,\nhowever, that have received little or no attention at all, despite its\nrelevance and applicability. One of such scenarios is early text\nclassification, where one needs to know the category of a document by using\npartial information only. A document is processed as a sequence of terms, and\nthe goal is to devise a method that can make predictions as fast as possible.\nThe importance of this variant of the text classification problem is evident in\ndomains like sexual predator detection, where one wants to identify an offender\nas early as possible. This paper analyzes the suitability of the standard naive\nBayes classifier for approaching this problem. Specifically, we assess its\nperformance when classifying documents after seeing an increasingly number of\nterms. A simple modification to the standard naive Bayes implementation allows\nus to make predictions with partial information. To the best of our knowledge\nnaive Bayes has not been used for this purpose before. Throughout an extensive\nexperimental evaluation we show the effectiveness of the classifier for early\ntext classification. What is more, we show that this simple solution is very\ncompetitive when compared with state of the art methodologies that are more\nelaborated. We foresee our work will pave the way for the development of more\neffective early text classification techniques based in the naive Bayes\nformulation.\n",

With a mean recognition\nrate of 55%, users can hardly distinguish between thetwo types of texts, and\ngive very similar ratings with respect to their language quality.

Furthermore, forecasters declared that all relevant\nsituations were captured by the system with sufficient accuracy.

We provide the\nfirst emoji sentiment lexicon, called the Emoji Sentiment Ranking, and draw a\nsentiment map of the 751 most frequently used emojis. The sentiment of the\nemojis is computed from the sentiment of the tweets in which they occur. We\nengaged 83 human annotators to label over 1.6 million tweets in 13 European\nlanguages by the sentiment polarity (negative, neutral, or positive). About 4%\nof the annotated tweets contain emojis. The sentiment analysis of the emojis\nallows us to draw several interesting conclusions.

In this study, we propose to\nuse BLSTM-RNN for a unified tagging solution that can be applied to various\ntagging tasks including part-of-speech tagging, chunking and named entity\nrecognition. Instead of exploiting specific features carefully optimized for\neach task, our solution only uses one set of task-independent features and\ninternal representations learnt from unlabeled text for all tasks.Requiring no\ntask specific knowledge or sophisticated feature engineering, our approach gets\nnearly state-of-the-art performance in all these three tagging tasks.\n",

It\nis also less constrained than the previous training algorithm using\nleave-one-out on training data: it allows the use of richer meta-features in\nthe adjustment model, e.g. the diversity counts used by Kneser-Ney smoothing\nwhich would be difficult to deal with correctly in leave-one-out training.\n  In experiments on the one billion words language modeling benchmark, we are\nable to slightly improve on our previous results which use a different loss\nfunction, and employ leave-one-out training on a subset of the main training\nset. Surprisingly, an adjustment model with meta-features that discard all\nlexical information can perform as well as lexicalized meta-features. We find\nthat fairly small amounts of held-out data (on the order of 30-70 thousand\nwords) are sufficient for training the adjustment model.\n  In a real-life scenario where the training data is a mix of data sources that\nare imbalanced in size, and of different degrees of relevance to the held-out\nand test data, taking into account the data source for a given skip-/n-gram\nfeature and combining them for best performance on held-out/test data improves\nover skip-/n-gram SNM models trained on pooled data by about 8% in the SMT\nsetup, or as much as 15% in the ASR/IME setup.\n  The ability to mix various data sources based on how relevant they are to a\nmismatched held-out set is probably the most attractive feature of the new\nestimation method for SNM LM.\n",

We\ncompare a range of state-of-the-art models, each with a different way of\nencoding what has been previously read. We show that models which store\nexplicit representations of long-term contexts outperform state-of-the-art\nneural language models at predicting semantic content words, although this\nadvantage is not observed for syntactic function words. Interestingly, we find\nthat the amount of text encoded in a single memory representation is highly\ninfluential to the performance: there is a sweet-spot, not too big and not too\nsmall, between single words and full sentences that allows the most meaningful\ninformation in a text to be effectively retained and recalled.

By analyzing the\ntrained larger- context language model, we discover that content words,\nincluding nouns, adjec- tives and verbs, benefit most from an increasing number\nof context sentences.

        "summary": "  Neural Machine Translation (NMT) has obtained state-of-the art performance\nfor several language pairs, while only using parallel data for training.\nTarget-side monolingual data plays an important role in boosting fluency for\nphrase-based statistical machine translation, and we investigate the use of\nmonolingual data for NMT. In contrast to previous work, which combines NMT\nmodels with separately trained language models, we note that encoder-decoder\nNMT architectures already have the capacity to learn the same information as a\nlanguage model, and we explore strategies to train with monolingual data\nwithout changing the neural network architecture. By pairing monolingual\ntraining data with an automatic back-translation, we can treat it as additional\nparallel training data, and we obtain substantial improvements on the WMT 15\ntask English<->German (+2.8-3.7 BLEU), and for the low-resourced IWSLT 14 task\nTurkish->English (+2.1-3.4 BLEU), obtaining new state-of-the-art results.

Considered\napplication scenarios range from portable translators for tourists, lectures\nand presentations translation, to broadcast news and shows with live\ncaptioning. We would like to present PJIIT's experiences in the SLT gained from\nthe Eu-Bridge 7th framework project and the U-Star consortium activities for\nthe Polish/English language pair.

        "summary": "  Text segmentation (TS) aims at dividing long text into coherent segments\nwhich reflect the subtopic structure of the text. It is beneficial to many\nnatural language processing tasks, such as Information Retrieval (IR) and\ndocument summarisation. Current approaches to text segmentation are similar in\nthat they all use word-frequency metrics to measure the similarity between two\nregions of text, so that a document is segmented based on the lexical cohesion\nbetween its words. Various NLP tasks are now moving towards the semantic web\nand ontologies, such as ontology-based IR systems, to capture the\nconceptualizations associated with user needs and contents. Text segmentation\nbased on lexical cohesion between words is hence not sufficient anymore for\nsuch tasks. This paper proposes OntoSeg, a novel approach to text segmentation\nbased on the ontological similarity between text blocks. The proposed method\nuses ontological similarity to explore conceptual relations between text\nsegments and a Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering (HAC) algorithm to\nrepresent the text as a tree-like hierarchy that is conceptually structured.\nThe rich structure of the created tree further allows the segmentation of text\nin a linear fashion at various levels of granularity. The proposed method was\nevaluated on a wellknown dataset, and the results show that using ontological\nsimilarity in text segmentation is very promising. Also we enhance the proposed\nmethod by combining ontological similarity with lexical similarity and the\nresults show an enhancement of the segmentation quality.\n",

C-LSTM utilizes CNN to extract a\nsequence of higher-level phrase representations, and are fed into a long\nshort-term memory recurrent neural network (LSTM) to obtain the sentence\nrepresentation. C-LSTM is able to capture both local features of phrases as\nwell as global and temporal sentence semantics.

The combination of source-to-pivot and pivot-to-target\ntranslation models can induce a new translation model through the pivot\nlanguage. However, the errors in two models may compound as noise, and still,\nthe combined model may suffer from a serious phrase sparsity problem. In this\npaper, we directly employ the word lexical model in IBM models as an additional\nresource to augment pivot phrase table. In addition, we also propose a phrase\ntable pruning method which takes into account both of the source and target\nphrasal coverage. Experimental result shows that our pruning method\nsignificantly outperforms the conventional one, which only considers source\nside phrasal coverage.

The proposed system follows a completely object\noriented approach, that models each rule as a class of its own and then groups\nthem as rule groups. The rule groups are decided on the basis of selective\ngrouping of rules by virtue of anuvrtti. The grouping of rules results in an\ninheritance network of rules which is a directed acyclic graph. Every rule\ngroup has a head rule and the head rule notifies all the direct member rules of\nthe group about the environment which contains all the details about data\nentities, participating in the derivation process.

For each component, we studied\nseveral statistical algorithms and empirically compared between them in terms\nof qualitative or quantitative analysis. Although we run experiments on Chinese\ncorpus, the method is language independent and can be easily adapted to other\nlanguage.

In\nthis paper, we address the last problem and propose a new discriminative\nentropy based intrinsic metric that works for both traditional word level\nmodels and unnormalized language models like sentence level models.

Aiming to resolve\nthese problems, we propose new variations of attention-based encoder-decoder\nand compare them with other models on machine translation. Our proposed method\nachieved an improvement of 2 BLEU points over the original attention-based\nencoder-decoder.\n",

        "summary": "  EvoGrader is a free, online, on-demand formative assessment service designed\nfor use in undergraduate biology classrooms. EvoGrader's web portal is powered\nby Amazon's Elastic Cloud and run with LightSIDE Lab's open-source\nmachine-learning tools. The EvoGrader web portal allows biology instructors to\nupload a response file (.csv) containing unlimited numbers of evolutionary\nexplanations written in response to 86 different ACORNS (Assessing COntextual\nReasoning about Natural Selection) instrument items. The system automatically\nanalyzes the responses and provides detailed information about the scientific\nand naive concepts contained within each student's response, as well as overall\nstudent (and sample) reasoning model types. Graphs and visual models provided\nby EvoGrader summarize class-level responses; downloadable files of raw scores\n(in .csv format) are also provided for more detailed analyses. Although the\ncomputational machinery that EvoGrader employs is complex, using the system is\neasy. Users only need to know how to use spreadsheets to organize student\nresponses, upload files to the web, and use a web browser. A series of\nexperiments using new samples of 2,200 written evolutionary explanations\ndemonstrate that EvoGrader scores are comparable to those of trained human\nraters, although EvoGrader scoring takes 99% less time and is free. EvoGrader\nwill be of interest to biology instructors teaching large classes who seek to\nemphasize scientific practices such as generating scientific explanations, and\nto teach crosscutting ideas such as evolution and natural selection. The\nsoftware architecture of EvoGrader is described as it may serve as a template\nfor developing machine-learning portals for other core concepts within biology\nand across other disciplines.\n",

        "title": "Smoothing parameter estimation framework for IBM word alignment models",
        "summary": "  IBM models are very important word alignment models in Machine Translation.\nFollowing the Maximum Likelihood Estimation principle to estimate their\nparameters, the models will easily overfit the training data when the data are\nsparse. While smoothing is a very popular solution in Language Model, there\nstill lacks studies on smoothing for word alignment. In this paper, we propose\na framework which generalizes the notable work Moore [2004] of applying\nadditive smoothing to word alignment models. The framework allows developers to\ncustomize the smoothing amount for each pair of word. The added amount will be\nscaled appropriately by a common factor which reflects how much the framework\ntrusts the adding strategy according to the performance on data. We also\ncarefully examine various performance criteria and propose a smoothened version\nof the error count, which generally gives the best result.\n",

        "summary": "  We present an approach to improve statistical machine translation of image\ndescriptions by multimodal pivots defined in visual space. The key idea is to\nperform image retrieval over a database of images that are captioned in the\ntarget language, and use the captions of the most similar images for\ncrosslingual reranking of translation outputs. Our approach does not depend on\nthe availability of large amounts of in-domain parallel data, but only relies\non available large datasets of monolingually captioned images, and on\nstate-of-the-art convolutional neural networks to compute image similarities.\nOur experimental evaluation shows improvements of 1 BLEU point over strong\nbaselines.\n",

In particular, we look at how\ntextual documents can be mined to extract events and ancillary information.\nThese days, it is mostly through the application of various machine learning\ntechniques. We also discuss applications of event detection and extraction\nsystems, particularly in summarization, in the medical domain and in the\ncontext of Twitter posts. We end the paper with a discussion of challenges and\nfuture directions.\n",
